LDA bad words:

hexadecimals(?) - 
address(?) -

I am writing thesis about summarizing DAO governance proposals. I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is widely used for topic modeling. I applied LDA to transform my collection of source texts into a set of topics. This process involves automatically assigning words to different topics based on their co-occurrence patterns and probability distributions within the text data.
The following will list 10 topics, each with the top 30 most frequently used words, with frequency of use listed in descending order. Name each topic uniquely based on the words listed.
