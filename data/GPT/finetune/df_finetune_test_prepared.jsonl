Following the RFP process approved in [EP2.2.4](ep2.2.4-social-ens-endaoment-rfp), the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards have selected a short list of potential fund managers for the DAO to elect to manage the ENS Endowment. Specification. [EP2.2.4](ep2.2.4-social-ens-endaoment-rfp) set out a process for fund managers to submit proposals to the Meta-Governance Working Group for consideration as fund managers over an ENS Endowment. The Endowments goal is to ensure the long-term viability of ENS by ensuring it can meet its ongoing financial obligations even in the face of reduced ETH price and registration\/renewal revenue. Eight submissions were made as a result of the RFP process, and the stewards have narrowed this down to three finalists. All three finalists are established actors with track records of fund management, and their proposals reflect an understanding of the low-risk, long-term sustainability approach that an endowment should take. Rather than select a winner themselves, the Meta-Governance Working Group Stewards believe that the selection of a fund manager should be put to the DAO. This EP implements a Snapshot vote using Ranked Choice voting with the following options: 1. Avantgarde. 2. Karpatkey. 3. Llama. 4. None of the above. Submissions for the vote are listed in alphabetical order. Following the conclusion of the vote, the Meta-Governance Stewards will work with the winning team to develop an initial treasury allocation strategy, resulting in a separate executable proposal to enact the initial setup of the endowment.

{"prompt":"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus, across five (5) Aave V3 Avalanche assets. There has been recent talk of price manipulation risks in the forums. This proposal only changes parameters for highly liquid assets on Aave V3 AVAX. Abstract. Over the last several months, Gauntlet has been building the simulation infrastructure to support risk management for Aave V3 AVAX. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate the Aave V3 AVAX protocol parameters. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX \/ CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

Our simulation analysis currently shows an opportunity to increase capital efficiency on Aave V3 AVAX without adding outsized market risk. The [optimal parameters]([link]) will slightly increase the Value at Risk (in the worst-case scenarios, our simulations estimate that there will be <200k additional insolvencies, which is approximately 0.006%) while meaningfully improving the capital efficiency of the system 2% increase in borrow usage in the system) Although our simulation engine recommends [optimal values]([link]), we recommend implementing a phased approach for this initial set of V3 AVAX recommendations to gather more granular data on user elasticity, which can be used to further fine-tune V3 simulation models.

Abstract. The Polygon Foundation team intends to distribute stMATIC and MaticX incentives to the wMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the 'EmissionManager' contract needs to assign an owner to the 'Emission_Admin' permission allowing stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed, [1,2] This can only be achieved via the governance process. This proposal assigns the 'Emission_Admin' permission to stMATIC and MaticX rewards to the following address '[hexadecimals]' Motivation. The motivation of the proposal is to enable stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the Lido community to distribute LDO rewards across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3] Specification. The Polygon Foundation team will determine the emission rate and duration at which stMATIC and MaticX rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAOs ability to adjust the wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the stMATIC \/ wMATIC and MaticX\/wMATIC loop. The 'Emission_Admin' is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool.

{"prompt":"--- title: [ARFC] wETH Interest Rate Curve - Ethereum v2. Discussion: [link] Short description: Upgrade wETH interest rate on Ethereum v2 to match Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. author: @Llamaxyz - Defi_Consulting. dated: 2023-01-29. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Following on from the forum discussion relating to wETH and wstETH interest rates across Ethereum v2 and v3, this Snapshot will focus on implementing the wETH interest rate parameter changes on Aave v2. Since the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. This proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend. Motivation. Since AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch) The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aaves wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below. !([link]]) The market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below: Structured products charge a fee Additional smart contract risk Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity. Our analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed. This proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1% The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1) Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. The graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves. !([link]]) The graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed. !([link]]) It is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95% Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced. The chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve. !([link]]) Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment. |Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)| | --- | --- | --- | |Uoptimal|80.00|80.00| |Base|0.00|1.00| |Slope1|5.75|3.80| |Slope2|80.00|80.00| |Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00| Copyright.

{"prompt":"This is a proposal to increase the quorum on the Angle Snapshot space to 10% of the veANGLE. supply. Context. Right now the quorum on Angle Snapshot space is 1000 veANGLE. This means that unnoticed proposals created and voted by addresses with less than 0.01% of the total voting power could pass. On governance proposals created on Angle Snapshot space, usually StakeDAO liquid locker is also voting which means that there should be no issue of quorum whatsoever (as StakeDAO controls 50% of the veANGLE supply) Yet, if StakeDAO was to put a quorum on its space, then there may be situations where StakeDAO is not voting on Angle space and the quorum on Angle space is effective. Proposal. This is a proposal to add a quorum to Angle Snapshot space such that governance votes created on the space are only effective if 10% of the total veANGLE supply at the time at which the vote is created actually votes for the proposal. Implementation. Right now, its not possible to update automatically the quorum based on dynamic values on Snapshot. The way this would be implemented is that the addresses controlling the space would manually and regularly update the quorum to make it match to 10% of the veANGLE supply. Value to the protocol. Having a quorum reduces the risks of having addresses with a very small amount of the total supply taking decisions on behalf of all the other veANGLE holders. This is what happened (on StakeDAO Snapshot space though) for the vote to add a timelock. Only one address with 2m sdANGLE voted on StakeDAO and its vote resulted in 56m veANGLE voting no against the proposal. If there had been a quorum on StakeDAO, the influence of this single address would have smaller relative to its actual weight, and most of all, the vote on Angle Snapshot space would have been given up because of quorum reasons. Here the output of the Timelock vote is mostly that one community member was against, not that there was a majority of the community against it. A quorum on Angle Snapshot space (if coupled with a quorum on StakeDAO space) is a way to ensure that proposals taken by the Angle protocol are considered by a significant portion of the DAO participants, and that no proposals are voted for and or against without the intervention of a big amount of stakeholders. Risks. The main risk with a quorum that is too high is that it may paralyze the state of the protocol, with no proposals being actually implementable. Here the threshold of 10% is chosen so as to limit this risk. Since it implies no off-chain action, quorum decisions could easily be reverted as well. Voting Options. 1. For, increase quorum. 2. Against, do nothing\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal suggests increasing the quorum on Angle Snapshot space from 1000 veANGLE to 10% of the total veANGLE supply.

The main risk with having a quorum too high is paralyzing decision making in the DAO, so 10% was chosen as a balance between security and efficiency.

{"prompt":"Author: . References: [GitHub - 1inch\/erc20-pods 7]([link]), [GitHub - 1inch\/farming 5]([link]), [GitHub - 1inch\/delegating 1]([link]) Simple Summary. --- This proposal seeks to implement a new Staking Pod mechanic for the 1INCH token. This system will consist of: - Incentivised time-locked 1INCH staking. - Permissionless delegation pods. - Reward distribution compatibility. - 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO protocol revenue shall be distributed to stakers. Abstract. --- With the Staking Pod system, users lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to get st1INCH tokens --- the longer the lock period, the more st1INCH tokens the user gets. st1INCH tokens can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance, and the 1inch DAO can choose to use these token balances for reward distribution. The system is modular as anyone can launch a new Modular Delegation Pod and can use the reward functionality to incentivize certain actions and\/or assign utility to the 1INCH token. 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue shall be distributed to stakers. Motivation. --- 1INCH token is the governance token of the 1inch Network. It provides voting rights within the 1inch DAOs governance system, and users can stake it to receive a [refund 3]([link]) on their transaction fees. However, despite these functions, the amount of 1INCH tokens currently being held in [staking contracts is quite low]([link]) and governance participation is even lower. We believe that this is due to a lack of incentives to participate in governance and a lack of additional utility for staked 1INCH. By introducing Modular Staking Pods, we hope to give stakers more direct control over how their stake is used to power the 1inch Network. This change will allow them to independently select how their stake governs each of the protocols and will allow for rewards to permissionlessly be distributed based on the actions of the stakers. We envision that this will improve the goverance by aligning incentives between people who want to stake to earn rewards and those who are interested in protocol governance -- both players will have direct incentives to participate in the same system. We believe that this proposal represents a step forward for the 1inch Network and that it will help increase adoption and usage of the networks future protocols. Specification. --- !([link]) Staking. Like the existing 1INCH staking contract, users will be able to lock their 1INCH tokens in the staking contract to get st1INCH tokens that can be used for 1inch DAO governance. However, unlike the current system, Modular Staking will require users to lock their 1INCH for a set amount of time. Locking. The minimum and maximum lock periods are chosen by the DAO through --- for the purposes of analysis, we'll use 1 month and 2 years as the minimum and maximum staking periods respectively. st1INCH tokens grant users \"voting power\" which they can use for various use cases. The longer the locking period the more \"voting power\" resolver can get. However, the increase in power is not linear. ![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885266-y]([link]) There will be a minimum locking period of 1 month. Note that st1INCH voting power will decay over time according to the locking curve. Also note that users can re-lock their stake at any time to refresh their st1INCH balance. Users will be able to withdraw their stake early but will forfeit a portion of their rewards. ![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885267-y]([link]) Orange is the amount lost when a staker withdraws earlier than they originally committed. Example: - In 2023, Sally stakes 100 1INCH and selects a 2-year lock period. - They receive 100 st1INCH from the staking contract and this balance decays over time. - By 2024 Sallys st1INCH balance has decayed to 22.36. - Sally then chooses to re-lock her stake for the maximum amount of time, 2-years, and her st1INCH balance is increased to 100. - Sally chose not to re-lock, and in 2026, after the lock period, she withdraws her original 100 1INCH. Unlocking. If a st1INCH staker wishes to unlock they will forfeit some of their tokens based on the following equation: withdrawalAmount = (balance - votingPower) \/ 0.9. penalty = balance - withdrawalAmount. In this setting, the maximum early withdrawal loss is 90% as the minimum locking period is 1 month. Admin Control. The 1inch DAO Treasury Address, [[hexadecimals]]([link]), would act as admin of the staking contract with control over the following functions: - setFeeReceiver -- this would allow the DAO to change the vault to collect the rewards for later distribution between stakers and the DAO treasury. - setDefaultFarm -- this would allow the DAO to change the default reward distribution contract for 1INCH staking. - setMaxLossRatio -- this would allow the DAO to change the earliest point at which people can early withdraw their stake by disallowing withdrawals with larger withdrawal fees. - setEmergencyExit -- This is basically an abort function and would allow the DAO to end the staking scheme. All stakers can reclaim the entire amount of their original stake regardless of their remaining locking period. This would be used if the DAO wanted to migrate to a new staking contract to change key variables, like the maximum lock period. Modular Delegation. The Modular Delegation system provides users with a set of delegation contracts that are specific to a topic. The set of delegation contracts is permissionless, meaning that anyone can deploy one and allow users to delegate their st1INCH within it. The 1inch DAO will have the power to endorse a delegation contract and feature it in the 1inch staking UI. For the start, we propose just two delegation topics: Snapshot governance delegation - This will allow users to delegate their Snapshot voting power to a recognized delegate from the UI, or manually enter an Ethereum\/ENS address. - Nested within this is the vanilla[Snapshot space-specific delegation contract 1]([link]) st1INCH utility delegation - As part of this staking upgrade, there will be a new protocol added to 1inchs suite of DeFi tools that will substantially improve the utility of st1INCH. - Service providers that want to tap into the utility of st1INCH can proposition the community for delegated power. Rewards. Modular Staking will have two levels of reward functionality: Generic st1INCH rewards and Modular Delegation rewards. Generic st1INCH rewards. The st1INCH contract will allow anyone to run a farm to distribute rewards to everyone holding st1INCH tokens. Users also have the ability to to join as many farms as they want as it does not required a user to move their st1inch to a specific farm. Along as a user holds st1inch in their account, they can receive rewards from multiple farms. This proposal calls for 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue to be distributed to stakers in the form of 1INCH. Modular Delegation rewards. Some Modular Delegation contracts have an integrated rewards function that anyone can run a farm atop. The main advantage to this type of reward is that it is not limited to being proportional to a users st1INCH holdings. Any action, onchain or offchain, can be used as the basis of reward distribution. This functionality could be used by the 1inch DAO to incentivize anything from editing 1IPs to using a new 1inch protocol (and everything in between) Example: The 1inch DAO may use the Snapshot governance delegation contract to incentivize active governance participation by boosting the st1INCH rewards of people who vote on proposals, delegate their st1INCH to active voters, etc. Rationale. --- The rationale for this proposal is to provide a more flexible staking system that can be used to incentivize various activities within the 1inch Network. The new Modular Delegation contracts will allow for rewards to be distributed based on anything from voting on proposals to using new 1inch protocols. This will provide a greater incentive for users to participate in the network and help drive adoption of new 1inch products and services. Considerations. --- The security considerations for this proposal are mainly around the potential for abuse of the new staking and delegation contracts. It is important to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent users from delegating their voting power to malicious actors. The governance considerations for this proposal include the impact on revenue streams and changes to the governance processes. This proposal could potentially increase revenue for the 1inch DAO if it is successful in incentivizing more users to participate in the network. It is also worth considering how these changes will impact existing voting processes within the 1inch DAO since the existing staking contract will be deprecated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal seeks to implement a new staking system for 1INCH tokens. This system involves incentivizing users to lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to receive \"st1INCH\" tokens, which can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance activities and also has rewards associated with it. The minimum lock period is one month and the maximum two years, with reward distribution being based on how long the token is locked for - the longer it is locked, the bigger the reward. Additionally, 50% of all current and future revenue from the 1inch DAO protocol will be distributed among these stakers. Finally, Modular Delegation Pods are included in this plan which allows anyone to launch new delegation pods that incentivize certain actions or assign utility to the 1INCH token.\n"}
{"prompt":"Summary. Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put Weighted and ComposableStable pools in Recovery Mode. Authorize Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to manage the RecoveryModeEnabler contract. Motivation. It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to 'getRate' reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pools internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction. In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper]([link]), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts. The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache. When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool. The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts. The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. The initial set includes the [ComposableStable]([link]) and [Weighted]([link]) pool factories deployed in September. If approved, this proposal will also authorize the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to add\/remove factories to\/from this set - but in addition to that safety mechanism, permissions will still have to be granted by Governance for each new factory individually just like in this proposal.

{"prompt":"Summary: Enable a Balancer gauge for the Polygon jEUR - agEUR stable pool, coined 2eur (agEUR) agEUR and jEUR are both crypto-backed Euros stablecoins. agEUR is issued by Angle Protocol and jEUR by Jarvis Network. Angle Protocol and Jarvis Network co-write the proposal and already have a history of incentivizing together a 4eur and a 2eur (agEUR) pools on Curve for more than a year. Angle and Jarvis want to migrate the 2eur (agEUR) pool from Curve to Balancer. References\/Useful links: Jarvis Network: Link to: Website: [link] Documentation: [[link]]([link]) Code: [link] Social: [link] Audits: [link] Angle Protocol: Link to: Website: [[link]]([link]) Documentation: [link] Code: [link] Social: [link] Audits: [link] Protocol Description: Jarvis Network. Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy, Dotdot, etc.) Angle Protocol. Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has launched agEUR, a Euro stablecoin, which has become one of the biggest decentralized Euro stablecoin. The TVL in the Angle Protocol is $46m with 30m agEUR in circulation. There are different mechanisms (also called modules) by which agEUR can be issued all having in common that agEUR must be released on the market in an over-collateralized way. - In the Core module of the protocol, agEUR can be minted from USDC, DAI and FRAX at oracle value. The protocol insures itself against the $\/ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by relying on the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol and by transaction fees. agEUR issued from this means represent the biggest share of the agEUR in circulation, and they are currently over-collateralized at 200% - The protocol also has a borrowing module where agEUR can be borrowed against different assets (ETH, wBTC, wstETH) like on Maker. This module is deployed on different chains (including Polygon) - The protocol is also engaged in algorithmic market operations (also called direct deposit modules) It has for instance minted agEUR natively on Aave and on Euler. In these cases, agEUR enter in circulation when they are borrowed in an over-collateralized way on the corresponding protocol. Protocol also mints agEUR on the agEUR-EUROC Curve pool when this pool has more EUROC than agEUR (like what FRAX is doing) [agEUR]([link]) has kept a super tight peg since its launch. It is involved in several other gauges on Curve as well (agEUR-EURs-EURt, agEUR-ibEUR, agEUR-EUROC-cEUR, agEUR-EUROC) which have historically yielded a pretty important volume. Motivation: The role of the 2eur (agEUR) pool is to increase the stability of agEUR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both agEUR and jEUR (2), and connect the Angle and Jarvis ecosystems (3) Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem. 1. agEUR peg: on Polygon, agEUR is issued following the CDP model; if agEUR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy agEUR cheaper and repay their debt; if agEUR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow agEUR and sell them at a higher price; users can also perform a cross-chain arbitrage between Ethereum and Polygon (since on Ethereum one can swap agEUR for USDC at the EURUSD Chainlink price feed without price impact) but since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH\/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact on Polygon, arbitrages can be directly performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the agEUR peg. 2. On-chain liquidity: agEUR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH, MAI or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap agEUR to jEUR and then to USDC, MAI or ETH to access the latters liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases agEUR liquidity. jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and agEUR has a deep liquidity on Polygon, to which jEUR can connect. 3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Angle and its agEUR liquidity and ecosystem to the jEURs, enabling multiple use cases. Credit without FX risk: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.) or agEUR (Mt Pelerin, Monerium, .) Leverage short on EUR\/XXX: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR, swap for ETH, MAI or USDC, and repeat. DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: both agEUR and jEUR have a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Mt Pelerin, but it comes with a high fee. jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, so this pool can help users to buy agEUR with Euros or to sell agEUR for Euros. A few notes: Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80\/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis \/ DotDot) With Angle, we have been launching the 2eur (agEUR) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $14M since April 2022, with a TVL of $1-$3M, $6.9M of which were pure arbitrages. It is the most traded 2eur pool among PAR, EURT, EURS and EURe. Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield. Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (agEUR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs.

{"prompt":"Optimization of LDO in LEGO budget: Reviewing historical data, we noticed 60% of grantees requested to be paid in stablecoins.

As part of the Sunsetting of v1, the v2 -> v3 Migration & the Deprecation of v2 discussions being conducted by the community [here]([link]) and [here]([link]), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets: - Aave v1 \\(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\\) - Aave v2 \\(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\\) Abstract. With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add\/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments. Note: The Aave Arc & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the \"Permissioned\" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the \"Permissioned\" code base. Motivation. This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments. Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates.

{"prompt":"The combination of the high technical requirements to run on Gnosis Chain and a low point in the economic cycle (which has a -ve effect on the GNO price and hence node operator revenue) have created unfavourable economics for running nodes on GC. While it is the duty of the node operators to anticipate the changes in the economics of their business in advance, the issue at hand here is the need to urgently re-home a large number of validators without acting against the node operators' will. In other words, we cannot force them to take on the keys that will lose them more money than before, but still need to allocate almost 10,000 keys to someone. This calls for a structural change in our product on Gnosis Chain. We believe such structural change would be to increase the staking fee to 15% of the rewards. The benefit of increasing the fee to 15% is that there is less contribution to further centralization because more operators can handle the financial requirements of supporting GC at this price point. The drawback, of course, is the higher fee that will be applied to stakers as a result of this change. To put this into numbers, stakers will lose ca 0.6 percentage points of consensus-level rewards (annualised), earning 10.04% APR after the change (vs 10.66% APR now) We believe this is a tolerable reduction given the importance of keeping Gnosis Chain decentralized and the validator performance as solid as possible.

This USDC would then be used to purchase ETH that is locked into Stargate POL and supports Stargate liquidity on Ethereum. Assuming a target APY of 5%, this would reduce STG emissions by $100,000 per year and strengthen Stargates permanent liquidity. It is important to surface any proposals like this to the community to allow the Stargate DAO to make the determination around what to do with them and how to address the request.

{"prompt":"' Author: Cameron O'Donnell. Email: . Telegram: @DAOstrat. ' Intro. gm Hop community! Cameron here on behalf of ConsenSys. We are proud to engage with such an active community. Most people know ConsenSys for Metamask, Infura, and Truffle, but we're here to talk about something else: a zkEVM Rollup. We recently launched the [Testnet]([link]) (open only for allowlist users) and are reaching out to propose deploying Hop for the ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet and subsequent Mainnet. ConsenSys follows the progression of the Hop ecosystem closely and even recently integrated Hop into our [bridging aggregator]([link]) Hop is a unique and critical piece of infrastructure that seamlessly bridges assets between chains. Proposal Details. Proposal. This proposal asks the Hop community to support bridging using the protocol between the ConsenSys zkEVM and other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Specifically, this will integrate various protocol features with the trustless ConsenSys zkEVM token bridge. This will help provide sufficient bridging liquidity for future Testnet users. (330K signups as of today) ConsenSys team members are in contact with Authereum (DBA Hop Labs) and are excited to work on this together. Motivation. What is particularly exciting about the ConsenSys zkEVM is that it is a type 2 zkEVM. As a result, it is EVM equivalent, meaning existing smart contracts, toolsets, and release processes can be easily deployed without substantial modifications. This means de minimis switching costs for dApp developers. During the Testnet phases and Mainnet, we expect a robust user base that will drive activity to the Hop protocol (and community) as demand for bridging increases. Also, the protocol will be the first to integrate with the native zkEVM bridge, which is a significant opportunity for the Hop ecosystem. Bridge Deployments. Bridges play a key role in Layer 2 Rollups; we look at it as one of the central pillars of the tech stack. Currently, we are running a native trustless messaging and token bridge used for ERC20s from Layer 1. In addition, as strong supporters of Hop, We forked the Hop frontend and adopted it for this first phase of the zkEVM Testnet. Bridges and related contracts are deployed and managed by the core protocol dev team with support from ConsenSys. Authereum is aware of the considerations and excited to work with us on the ConsenSys zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM. Type 2 zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper. Unlike other rollups, the Consensys zkEVM does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks. Timeline\/Next Steps. The Request For Comment was posted in the Forums on January 19, 2023. The proposal is now posted in Snapshot. Once these steps are completed, we will team up with a Delegate to post the On-chain proposal. Conclusion. Consensys looks forward to strengthening our partnership with Hop through direct integrations. Supporting bridging to and from the ConsenSys zkEVM will allow for a seamless user experience and drive growth for the Hop ecosystem. We look forward to the discussion below!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about integrating the Hop protocol with the ConsenSys zkEVM to allow for seamless bridging between various chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.

{"prompt":"Authors Samuel McCulloch. Summary Authorize matching FRAX from the FXS buyback fund with Fraxs ARB airdrop to create ARB-FRAX liquidity using funds set aside from FIP-77. Background and Motivation In June of last year, [Frax was appropriated $20m dollars in FIP-77]([link]) to use for FXS buybacks. Since being approved, approximately $2m FRAX has been used for this purpose. On March 23, 2023, Frax received over 500,000 ARB from the Arbitrum Foundation as part of their airdrop. Frax can either use this ARB to take part in governance or it can be used to deepen liquidity on Curve, Fraxswap and Uniswap. Frax should be allowed to use part or all of the FXS buyback fund to create new protocol owned liquidity on Arbitrum using part or all of its ARB airdrop.

{"prompt":"Summary. This proposal asks for approval of the community to define (keep or change) the pricing approach of WBTC on Aave. The options are: 1) keep the pricing of WBTC based on the underlying BTC, same as currently on Aave v2 Ethereum and other pools OR 2) change the pricing model to use WBTC-based feeds. Context. There has been extensive discussion on [[link]]([link]) about the topic, and with Aave v3 Ethereum upcoming, it is fundamental for the community to take a decision. Generally, the risk entities currently engaged with the Aave community agree that using a WBTC\/USD (or ETH) feed with option 2 can bring some benefits to the pool. From the technical side, at BGD we think both options are perfectly legitimate, but when having enough liquidity (and WBTC seems to have it), usually it is better to price directly based on the asset itself. What the approval of this proposal implies? Whatever option the community adopts will be applied on Aave v3 Ethereum. If the option selected is 2), we will work on adapting all other Aave instances to use the new pricing approach. Given this proposal will authorise to already doing changes in production, the requirements are the same as on Level 1 of the Aave governance: 320k votes on the \"winning\" option and 80K differential between them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is asking the community to decide on how to price WBTC on Aave.

{"prompt":"Summary: Establish an ongoing budget for voting market incentives in order to increase OHM pair liquidity and accumulate additional strategic assets. This will be capped at $400,000 every two weeks. Background: TAP-15 permitted Olympus DAO to explore the use of incentives as a means to boost voting power to its LP Gauges. Starting the week of March 6th, 2023, Olympus Treasury committed $100,000 USDC to its OHM\/ETH Pool located on AURA as a pilot. The results of these efforts were favorable and resulted in the pool seeing between 10-14% vAPR over the epoch. As part of the strategic vision outlined in the recent Treasury RFC, we plan to keep the AURA and use it to increase our market share within the AURA Ecosystem. This will also be used to further vote the gauges that tactically align with our proposed policy. The other rewards will preferably be managed through OTC offers to further increase our AURA position and Balancer Gauge Weight (This is subject to a cap of 5% of veBAL Voting Power) Proposal: The Treasury Team requests community approval of a per epoch (Two Week) budget, not to exceed $400,000, for use in Hidden Hand \/ Paladin incentivized markets. This will serve as a means of efficiently increasing our $AURA and $BAL ownership over time while simultaneously receiving high emissions towards our OHM pools. The list of potential assets used to incentivize will include: OHM (Preferred) USDC. DAI. FRAX. OHM utilized will either come from OHM already owned by the Treasury or minted specifically for this purpose. Proceeds will be managed to ensure the process is accretive (even in the case of new OHM entering circulating supply) For example: For the 3\/6\/23 AURA\/HH Epoch, 88k net incentives yielded 1.55m votes. These votes produced approximately $123,000 estimated incremental yield. Therefore, this was accretive to Treasury and favorably impacted Liquid Backing. Additionally, this is consistent with our goals of accumulating increased governance power in the Balancer ecosystem. This budget will exist for the remainder 2023, at which time the budget will be re-evaluated for size and scope.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about setting up an ongoing budget of $400,000 every two weeks so that Olympus DAO can use incentives to boost their voting power on their LP Gauges.

{"prompt":"Hi everyone, This is a proposal to seed an agEUR-USDT pool on PancakeSwap to bootstrap Angle liquidity on BNB Chain. Context. Angle Protocol recently deployed agEUR on BNB Chain, as [announced]([link]) on October 21, 2022 on the protocols Twitter account. BNB Chain is a major Layer 1 with now more unique adresses than Ethereum. Given its great number of protocols deployed and number of users exceeding all other alternative chains, building agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain is an important step to the development of agEUR. Considering that the protocol has accumulated a surplus from it operations since its launch in November 2021, it is suggested that this surplus be partly used to support agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain and more particularly on PancakeSwap. One way of supporting liquidity is to seed a first pool using both the protocol surplus and agEUR minted in the market through [Direct Deposit Modules]([link]) Proposal. The proposal is to use 150k USDC from the protocols surplus, to be converted to USDT and bridged to BNB Chain, mint a corresponding amount of agEUR on BNB Chain, and then seed a agEUR\/USDT pool on PancakeSwap. The exact amount of agEUR to mint will depend on the initial EUR\/USD price at the time of the implementation. Note that if you want to play with impermanent loss simulation, we have built a simulator on the Angle App at Angle Protocol. Implementation. The minted agEUR would be from AMOs. As previously discussed in similar instances, the rationale for minting agEUR that way is that the protocol could technically fetch the required amount from its surplus but there will be an opportunity cost for doing so since the USDC fetched from the surplus would no longer be invested in the yield strategies of the protocols. With $150k worth of agEUR from AMOs, these agEUR are still backed by the USDC that are used to issue them and if the value of the USD came to decrease (meaning that a portion of the agEUR issued through AMO would be \"unbacked), then the protocol could still rely on its surplus to hedge for the \"loss. As such, using AMOs is a way to mitigate the opportunity cost while still relying in some way on the surplus the protocol has accumulated. In addition, this amount is a conservative amount to bootstrap liquidity. As this goes live, its going to be important for the protocol to increase or decrease the size of the positions depending on volume. Value to the protocol. Deploying a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap is intended to unleash a wide range of opportunities for agEUR in the BNB ecosystem allowing it to be more easily integrated with the protocols that are getting built there. Bootstrapping agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain through PancakeSwap is also an efficient choice for the protocol as PancakeSwap is the most popular and most used DEX on BNB with roughly $50m to $100m+ daily volume. Risks. This proposal bears a risk of bad debt also possible with the agEUR paired with USDT in the AMOs, but given the size of the pool proposed and the surplus currently incurred by the protocol, this can reasonably be considered as acceptable. Please comment below with any input you may have. The suggested amounts and ranges chosen can be discussed and amended according to community feedback. Voting Options. 1. For, seed pools. 2. Against, do nothing\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about using some of the surplus that Angle Protocol has accumulated to seed a pool on PancakeSwap for agEUR and USDT.

{"prompt":"[link] Summary. Pocket Network is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the RPC layer. Our goal is to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving, multi-chain gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers to mint reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported, including both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival. Over the last month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 2 spot in terms of requests per day at 195M daily avgerage requests according to POKTscan! Abstract. By sponsoring a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, GnosisDAO and Pocket Network would continue to contribute to the decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All the while, continuing to incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens for serving Gnosis dapps. Public RPCs are a public good, we hope to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users. The Pocket Network team and community have been a long-time supporters of the Gnosis Chain. We're proud to continue supporting Gnosis! Motivation. The current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) we suport are: Gnosis Chain = 0027 (mainnet) Gnosis Chain Archival = 000C (mainnet) The POKTdao allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07\/06\/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival (000C) shortly after on 08\/26\/21) Since the allowlist date, Pocket node operators earned 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read\/write requests. See this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned: [link] Over that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated, stable, and higher-performant pools of nodes. Our network of node runners easily handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day recently in JAN 2023. According to POKTscan, there are currently 22,379 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,561 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain ID. This demonstrates the POKT node incentives at work! The POKTdao supported node deployment solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode to make it super easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full\/archival nodes within the Pocket Network protocol. Rationale. Pocket Network Inc. staked POKT on behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsizie a public good in the form of public RPC endpoints (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits: [link] [link] We've simplified our model this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more affordable. To sweeten the deal, we are offering the Gnosis DAO team and community a massive discount on a 200M requests per day throughput on a 1-year commitment with the option to renew on an annual basis: $135,997 USD for 200M Requests Per Day on a 1-year Contract (i.e. next 12 months) That represents 4.8x in savings (a 480% discount) compared to the original offer! In case a buffer is wanted\/needed, as traffic continues to grow, we'd like to extend another option to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price of $0.0000018640 per request throughout the contract period. Public RPCs are a public good, we hope to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users. The GnosisDAO will be able to monitor and manage the public RPCs through our Pocket Portal as they see fit, including the ability to enable additional security features such as allowlisting user-agents, origins, smart contracts, and methods.

{"prompt":"Author: Jesse | gldnXross6482. GotchiID: 4563. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days. Final Discourse Thread: [link] Original Discourse Thread: [link] INTRODUCTION. AavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST Bonding Curve. This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAOs DAI stable coin. Closing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30\/30\/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions. The Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today. \"The Curve is forever is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHSTs tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion. While MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the \"Endgame plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool. Even if one concludes that DAIs risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAIs depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable. Aavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own. AavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the companys readiness to also manage the DAI at scale. With nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC'd and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people! It is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve. Allocation of the Curves DAI. Turning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems. So far, the DAI in the Curves contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curves closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol. I have offered a separate Signal Proposal to allocate 70% of such DAI to AavegotchiDAO (40% of the total DAI collateral being earmarked specifically for Liquidity Provisions in a separate multisig) and the remaining 30% to go to the team that kickstarted it all and continues to develop both the protocol and the Gotchiverse, Pixelcraft Studios. Take this proposal and the allocation proposal into consideration together. If my proposed allocation does not pass, there would need to be a new Signal Proposal to take its place before the process of closing the Curve could begin. Process: This proposal is for us to close the GHST Bonding Curve in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps: 1. Pass an AGIP on Snapshot confirming AavegotchiDAOs intention and terms. 2. Migrate the required 8% of total GHST supply back to Ethereum so we can reach quorum in our Curves on-chain voting system (long established on Aragon contracts) 3. Complete the Aragon-based vote. It is at this point the Curve will immediately close and any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the original Snapshots terms. 4. The Curve closes and all DAI are distributed according to the terms decided by AavegotchiDAO in a subsequent AGIP. Risks. The risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes. Without deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market. There is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility. Benefits. The benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review: 1. Remove all risk of Aavegotchis success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI) 2. Complete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties. 3. Improve GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time. Conclusion. For the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystems meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we've learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the visions development is completely within AavegotchiDAOs control. We are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Lets use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is suggesting that the AavegotchiDAO close the GHST Bonding Curve and use the DAI in this curve when it closes to secure funds for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios. It proposes a 70\/30 split of these funds, with 40% earmarked for Liquidity Provisions in a separate multisig account, 30% going toPixelcraft Studios (the team who kickstartedAavegotchi) and an additional 40% allocated to the DAO. The closing of the Curve will be done in a controlled manner by following certain steps like passing an AGIP on Snapshot, migrating 8% of total GHST supply back to Ethereum so quorum can be reached in voting system etc. The main benefits proposed are derisking from reliance on MakerDAO, securing significant funding as well as improving GHST tokenomics by making it more accessible.\n"}

{"prompt":"Pool10. We propose allocating 19,621 PSP rewards to users staking in sPSP10 by the middle of Epoch 24 (block 15712957) to rectify the volume it accrued while the staking system was not automatically reporting it. To compensate the Market Maker, we propose sending 19,621 PSP rewards to the Market Maker vesting contract. Pool4. Meanwhile, to deal with the external circumstances of Wintermute temporarily pausing DeFi operations, we propose: 1) Final distribution of 170,000 PSP to the users staking in sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 stakers by the middle of epoch24 (block 15712957) to cover for their Accrued Yield losses on sPSP4 while we propose moving into the new transition system for PSP 2.0. 2) Pausing of Pool4 deposits. 3) Reduction of cooldown to 2 days to allow an easier transition into another pool. Both pool4 and pool10 rewards will be distributed via a distribution contract, and users will need to claim from a native UI to be built after the vote passes. Context. The current PSP staking system consists of a stake-to-signal mechanism in which stakers opt into any of the different ParaSwapPools representing Private Market Makers. Recently, ParaSwapPool10s wallet change led to an epoch period (Epoch 24) in which, despite the Private Market Maker still accruing volume, no yield was reported to stakers. This led to ParaSwapPool10 stakers not receiving the yield they should have during Epoch 24. This proposal aims to solve this situation by distributing the missed rewards to wallets that were staking by the middle of Epoch 24, hence did not have time to change to another pool and get that pools rewards. Additionally, the proposal will send the corresponding Market Maker rewards to the Market Makers vesting contract. Additionally, Wintermute, the Private Market Maker behind Pool4, has ceased operations following a hack. This circumstance has been outside the control of both stakers and ParaSwap. For that reason, we propose to assist stakers of this pool in transitioning easier to a new Market Maker and receiving a legacy amount of emissions as we begin transitioning to the new system. To make a fair estimate of the legacy amount (170,000 PSP) we took into account the average last 6 epoch rewards allocated to Pool4. Goals and Means. - To compensate previously missed rewards for Pool10 stakers. - Provide 19,621 PSP to Pool10 (sPSP10) mid of epoch 24 stakers and 19,621 PSP for Market Maker, totaling 39,242 PSP. - Provide 170,000 PSP to sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 mid of epoch 24 stakers as an early migration into the PSP2.0 transition system and compensate for Accrued Yield losses. - Pause deposits into sPSP4. - Reduce cooldown to 2 days on sPSP4. Forward Thinking Considerations. Assuming the proposal for PSP 2.0 passes, all future pools will receive similar emissions for users, as they will no longer be tied to Market Maker performance. This proposal will not interfere with the current PSP 2.0 discussion, as this one only deals with epoch 24. Eligible addresses.

{"prompt":"Summary: Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet. Proposal TL;DR: Aave has been trailblazing DeFi since inception and continues to embrace new frontiers and innovation to this day. The protocol has become a dominant player in DeFi lending across networks - be it alt L1s or L2s. Scroll wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and propose to the Aave community to authorize the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet. Zk rollups are widely considered to be the holy grail of Ethereum scaling. Recent breakthroughs have allowed the space to mature much faster than originally anticipated 1, which has positioned Scroll to build the next generation of scaling solutions that has achieved: - bytecode compatibility with the EVM: No new languages, tooling, trust in custom architecture or re-audits needed. Aave will be able to port over its codebase instantly and seamlessly without any extra engineering resources required. - top-tier security through process and architecture: Scroll has been open-sourced from day one and has been designed to prioritize the decentralization of its prover and sequencer networks, making it unique in the zk rollup space. - pushing boundaries of cutting edge research: Establishing a presence on Scroll will allow Aave to capture the zkEVM market in advance and reap L2 native innovation from the start and even contribute to steering how L2 user behavior will evolve short and long-term. Generally, we believe that Aaves community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit or location. In the following we detail Scrolls architecture and mission and how it will benefit the Aave community. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the communitys questions. About Scroll Scroll 1 is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent zk rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security. EVM equivalence & Developer Friendliness: Anything less than bytecode level compatibility is an unnecessary risk that protocols should not settle for. We don't think developers should have to learn a new language or trust custom architecture which introduces unknown risk. Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure and will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously. - Community first: Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community for the community! That also means that Scroll has been peer reviewed and open source from day one. We intend to follow this strategy going forward. We will foster community innovation and participate in the incubation of new open source tools and features for the L2 space. We intend to be the 1 platform for developers and we are working with the best to achieve this (Ethereum Foundation (PSE), 0xparc, zcash, Filecoin, and many more) - Decentralization & Security: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is committed to outsource proof generation. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem. In addition to that Scroll has a strong in-house security team that found and reported bugs in fellow zk RUs proving systems in the past. - Education & Research: We pride ourselves in making research accessible to all. We continuously publish research in an effort to demystify the inner works of zk circuits (see [link] and our public zk reading group) Scroll has been able to establish a recognized and sought after brand within a short amount of time which is also due to event series like Rollup Day which was appreciated across the board of L2 industry leaders. - Advance Ethereums ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereums ultimate goal of \"zkSNARK Everything . Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum! We are live on testnet and our ecosystem is rapidly growing. Since the beginning of January 2023 our testnet has seen over 900k unique wallet addresses, and this month we've averaged over 500k transactions a day  all helping to test the robustness of our network. We have been working with major infrastructure players (including the Graph, Safe, Covalent, Orbiter, and many more) to add support for critical building blocks on the network, and we're working with best-in-class Ethereum dApps to join the network too (including Uniswap v3 on Scroll testnet) Aave on Scroll By launching on testnet, Aave has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with lending protocols such as Aave. Aave is a uniquely important DeFi lender in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that a zk L2 affords. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now (e.g. going beyond flashloans with atomic (cross zk-RU) txs in a post-Danksharding Ethereum and further use cases we'd love to co-develop) Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available. We are excited to help foster an ecosystem fuelled by creativity that revolves around Aave and the distribution of $GHO. Bridge Security Zk rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics. Currently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges. Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase. Timeline The Scroll team will first submit the necessary snapshots for deploying Aave v3 on our testnet, following the community guidelines and working with BDG Labs on what is required. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks and we commit to dedicating engineering resources to support the Aave integrations team. It is important to us to be closely in touch with the Aave community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.

Operations lost an additional member of the current Operations Workstream at the end of March with @WesleyGraves leaving his contributor role. There is a strong acknowledgement that Tylers interim position and @PTTs new full time role are only made possible by the remaining Operations Workstream contributors, @Tshifty and @MBMaria stepping up to take on new delegated tasks and responsibilities. As there are 2 Operations Assistant roles being absorbed in the remaining Operations Workstream, @Tshifty and @MBMaria will both be receiving a promotion from Operations Assistant to Operations Coordinator. This proposal expedites a search for a new Product Workstream leader to be identified and integrated, and upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream. Budget. Both the Product and Operations Workstreams will see decreases in their monthly spend if this proposal passes. The currently passed Product Budget has a monthly spend of: $28,245 in USDC. $8,587 in FOX. $36,832 Total. The new Product Budget would be: $22,081.92 in USDC. $5,500 in FOX. $27,581.92 Total. This is a decrease in Monthly Product USDC spend by $5,413.08, and a decrease in total Monthly Product spend by $9,250.08. The currently passed Operations Budget has a monthly spend of: $32,425.00 in USDC. $11,325.00 in FOX. $43,750.00 Total.

{"prompt":"Penn Blockchain (FranklinDAO) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync. Deploy Uniswap V3 to zkSync. Summary. To support Uniswaps multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community. zkSync ecosystem has over 100 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on\/off ramps, etc. Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation. zkSync shares Ethereums ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership. We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. About zkSync. zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup ([link]) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security. zkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers: EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps. ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools. Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source. Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability. Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code. There is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSyncs EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution. Security & Bridges. ZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. While developers are free to build their own bridge for any token, zkSync 2.0 has two default trustless bridges (one for ETH and one for ERC20 tokens) The bridges support arbitrary message passing and are secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus. Fraudulent messages are not possible. The only actions a malicious actor could take is to censor messages, confirm inclusion in a block and then discard the state change. Security is top of mind for zkSync ([link]) We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program ([link]) Proposal. Theres significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswaps place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem ([link]) Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswaps influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups. While the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the networks adoption and in turn, Uniswaps usage. License Exemption. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community for a license exemption. Governance at deployment will be subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control facilitated by the messaging bridge ([link]) Timeline. Following the Temperature Check, Consensus Check, and Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync. zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet early October ([link]) A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because its fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswaps relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The proposal is about deploying Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0.

{"prompt":". Title: [ARFC] Proposal for Deploying \"Whitelabel Aave V3 Market for RealT Tokens on GnosisChain. Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Date: 2023-02-15. . Summary: Realt is a Real Estate tokenization protocol that enables users to gain exposure to real estate properties that produce rent income directly paid on-chain. The RMM (RealT Market Maker) market based on Aave V2 has already reached ~10M$ in size since its launch. This ARFC proposes deploying a \"whitelabel version of Aave V3 for RealT tokens on the Gnosis Chain network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams. Motivation: The quality of the Aave V3 codebase has made it a recognizable and trustworthy asset in the DeFi community as illustrated by spark protocol recent ARC 7. Therefore, rather than \"reinventing the wheel, many projects are interested in deploying \"friendly forks of V3 that fit their own models. Aave is currently \"delegating off-chain collaterals to third parties, such as the Centrifuge RWA market, but this might change mid-term with GHO and off-chain collateral facilitators. At present, Aave is immature in this area, so allowing third parties to deploy these \"friendly forks or Aave whitelabel deployments can increase Aave technology adoption. RealT proposes a 20% profit-sharing arrangement with the Aave DAO for this deployment. In this context, \"profit refers to the assets redirected to the RMM collector contract via the reserveFactor collection from users having borrow positions on this market. Quarterly, Realt will deliver 20% of the balance of this contract to the Aave Ethereum collector contract 7. In the case of a future Aave V3 deployment on the Gnosis Chain, RealT will be able to implement a more automatic and decentralized way to deliver the revenue share to an Aave collector contract on the Gnosis Chain. This would allow for more seamless and efficient profit-sharing arrangements between RealT and Aave. While the RealT market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the RMM market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols. Specification: No on-chain AIP or technical implementation is required for this ARFC. Therefore, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon. Disclaimer: The Aave-Chan Initiative is not linked nor paid by RealT to publish this ARFC.

{"prompt":"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH. These parameter updates also represent Gauntlets first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX \/ CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Our recent [market downturn report]([link]) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | LINK Loan To Value | 70% | 67% | | LINK Liquidation Bonus | 6.3% | 5.0% | | LINK Liquidation Threshold | 78% | 75% | | WBTC Loan To Value | 70% | 69% | | WBTC Liquidation Bonus | 6.5% | 5.0% | | WBTC Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 76% | | WETH Loan To Value | 82.5% | 81% | | WETH Liquidation Bonus | 5.0% | 4.0% | | WETH Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 83% | See below volatility and exchange volume data from 05\/13 to 05\/26.

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | USDC Loan To Value | 85.5% | 87.5% | | USDC Liquidation Threshold | 88% | 90% | Risk Dashboard.

{"prompt":"Authors: [Trent]([link]) (PG Member), [Tim]([link]) (PG Member) Abstract. This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors. We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [PG twitter account]([link]) Context. 1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - \"Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting]([link]) current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ![0xsplits [image]]([link]) PG Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year \/ $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc) The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO]([link]), and the [vote]([link]) ([forum post]([link])) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. Proposal. We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guilds vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022]([link])), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community: Uniswaps long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients. Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework. Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. Next Steps. If this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Protocol Guild is a council of Ethereum protocol contributors who aim to address the challenges of attracting and retaining talent to work on the protocol.

{"prompt":"[PR with Payload]([link]) Summary: Proposal to add gauge support for the newly created unshETH 50\/50 USH\/ETH pool on Ethereum mainnet. unshETHs governance token, USH, has launched on both BNB and Ethereum mainnet. The initial liquidity mining program will end on April 5th. The unshETH team plans to conduct the next liquidity mining program on Balancer, and to expand the collaboration between unshETH and Balancer even further in the future. Moreover, unshETH is integrated with an ecosystem partner, Stargate, that will enable scaling of its liquidity. References\/Useful links: Website - [[link]]([link]) Documentation - [[link]]([link]) Github Page - [[link]]([link]) Communities - [link] Other useful links? Twitter - [[link]]([link]) Blog - [link] Protocol Description: unshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices. Within Ethereums DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETHs mission is simple  decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network. unshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship. LSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer. Motivation: unshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the first step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains. To achieve this, unshETH intends to begin its second liquidity mining incentives campaign (~1M USH) to veBAL\/vlAURA markets. Once this amount has been emitted unshETH will consider future incentives after evaluating the performance of the gauge and depending on future protocol developments. Details: Governance: unshETHs governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023. Oracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time. Omnichain: The USH token is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token. Audits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [[link]]([link]) Centralization vectors: The unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the projects dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance. With the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters. The deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH teams ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023. The launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights. Market History: The USH token was launched on 1\/31\/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VCs or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog ([link]) to: Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers) Team and early contributors. The airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign. Value: This pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for USH on Ethereum. This gauge is the first step in building a deep collaboration with the Balancer ecosystem and community that will create value for all stakeholders. Balancer and the ecosystem of partners that Balancer has created will be a key part of the growth of unsETH protocol into the market-leader in the nascent LSDfi category. $USH trading metrics as of 04\/03\/2023 (Sushiswap: [link]): Volume (24h) - $2,529,182 Fees (24h) - $7,588 Utilization (24h) - 106% Specifications: Gauge Weight Cap unshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10% The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes. unshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57. Gauge Type Note that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80\/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers. Core Pools Designation: While this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN\/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH\/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.

{"prompt":"Proposal. The Olympus council would like to propose several amendments to the original OIP-91, including introducing a re-election framework, reporting requirements, the number of council members, and several miscellaneous improvements. - The council proposes a 1-year term for elected council members. The council will be put up for a vote of confidence, voted on by OHM holders. If the vote of confidence passes, the council is elected for a period of 1 year. If the vote of confidence fails, an election process will take place to elect a new council. The election will be done by DAO contributors above level 4 (full time equivalent) This is an interim solution until we can cement this in an OCG structure. The framework for replacing council members during this term remain unchanged (see OIP-91) - The council proposes formalizing the reporting requirements by the council. We propose a council update every other month within the DAO. We propose a council update every other month for the community. - The council proposes reducing the number of council members from 7 to 5 to reflect the changes in overall DAO size and structure. Council Framework. To offset against major holiday periods, we suggest the term to start in February. (Re-)Election procedure. In the last week of January and July, a vote of confidence will be posted on snapshot (or any future governance platform) to poll if the community is in favor of continuing with the current council composition or if it feels changes are needed. To aid this process and give the community insights into the current workings of the council, a council update should be provided before going to a vote. The choice for not doing a full re-election process every 12 months is done to reduce overhead, avoid friction and keep the focus on building out Olympus as opposed to time-consuming election processes. If, however, the OHM holders are dissatisfied with the performance of the council, we propose the following framework: We propose a 2-week election timeline which would start immediately after the conclusion of a negative vote of confidence. Week 1: DAO contributors can flag their desire to run for council during this week in a public channel in the DAO server, to avoid any risk of censorship. During this week, candidates should lay out their motivations and vision for Olympus. Additionally, they should explain what they would bring to the council. Week 2: At the start of week 2, all candidates who have submitted their motivation will be able to present this to other DAO contributors during a voice call in the DAO, the order of presentation will be randomized to prevent any favoritism. After this call, a blind vote will take place where DAO contributors above level 4 will be able to cast votes to the amount of council seats. We opt for a blind vote to reduce animosity and friction between DAO contributors. In case two or more contributors have the same amount of votes, another round of voting will have to be executed with only these candidates on the ballot. After the conclusion of the voting round(s), a vote will be presented to the community to confirm the composition of this council. In case of a positive vote, a hand-over will take place between the original and new council members to ensure a smooth transition. During this time, the previous council is still active. If the vote gets rejected, the process will have to start over again until a council is approved by the holders. The newly elected council will take its place at the start of the next week on Monday and will present themselves to the community during the first following community call. This proposal combines both ownership of the OHM holders, who ultimately will have the power to push for a new council while still giving a voice to the DAO contributors, who will have to execute the vision of the council and has unique insights into the capabilities of the candidates. Council size. We propose the reduction of council members from 7 to 5 for the following reasons: - Since the introduction of the first council, the DAO has consolidated significantly. We feel it is appropriate for the council to be smaller as well. - The reduction would increase the efficiency of the council. In the past cycle, it could be difficult to get the opinion of 7 members at the same time. - The cost of the council would be reduced, leaving more budget for other departments. - Zeus has not been an active council member and has been acting more as a senior advisor to Olympus, a capacity he will still be involved in going forward. - Indigo has indicated that he would like to step down from the council for the next cycle to focus more on development. The remaining council members are Apollo, Hohmward, Jala, Shadow and Wartull. Update on reporting requirements. The council has evaluated feedback both from the community and the DAO contributors and identified the need for increased transparency on the workings and decisions of the DAO. For this, we propose: - A council update every other month within the DAO. - A council update every other month for the community. A community Q&A was conducted on Thursday the 2nd of February to address community questions on the roles and responsibilities of the council.

Summary Increase max authorized allocation of Fraxlend AMO for the following Fraxlend pair. |Fraxlend Pair Name|Fraxlend Pair Address|Current Max Authorized Allocation|Proposing Max Authorized Allocation| |---|---|---|---| |FraxlendV2 - Frax Price Index\/Frax - Variable Time-Weighted Interest Rate - 12|[[hexadecimals]]([link])|15,000,000 FRAX|25,000,000 FRAX| Background and Motivation. Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows the creation of a money market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token that is part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers, or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. Fraxlend creates new financial opportunities for all users and promotes FRAX adoption in the DeFi community. Since FIP - 137 authorized the Fraxlend AMO to issue a new FPI pair (FPI\/FRAX - Variable Rate V2), the pool has generated significant protocol revenues, as well as heavy lending and borrowing activity. Current pool utilization stands at 91% with total FPI collateral value at $17.8m. At time of writing, the lender APY is at 5.7% and borrower APY is at 6.2% Both rates are rising quickly. Building on the success of the FPI pool, additional AMO injected liquidity would help bring the target pool utilization back down to the nominal range of 75% to 85% More importantly, raising the liquidity cap would expand and diversify the borrower base to increase financial access for all users. We note that authorizing the new higher limit does not require the AMO to provide the specified liquidity. The liquidity will be authorized and available to be injected, consistent with the AMO operations framework and protocol risk parameters, to meet user demand as deemed appropriate by the Frax Team.

Optimism currently supports 100+ dapps and over $500m in on-chain value. Optimism drastically improves Ethereums scalability while retaining its security through rollup technology - having already saved its users over $1B in gas fees. The OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. OP holders are currently able to vote on various decisions impacting the Collective, including the grants, protocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, and other fundamental changes. The Collective is committed to an [iterative governance system]([link]) that will evolve dynamically over time. Optimism hopes to use the launch of this token to establish a deeper partnership between the Optimism and Aave communities. This proposal would enable OP as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism. Motivation. With the recent release of the OP token, we want to bolster initial growth for Aave V3 on Optimism. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave V3, while being a strong first use case for OP. Aave would be one of the first platforms to support OP as collateral. The OP token is one of the first and leading rollup technology ecosystem tokens, so the Aave community would be supporting the scaling of Ethereum and onboard the cohort of users coming with it. L2s being the home for AAVE v3 could also gain a lot from this synergy. Overall, the use cases will create the opportunity to continue growing liquidity and usage of the Aave v3 pools on Optimism. Specifications. The Optimism Foundation is submitting this ARC. The Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company. It serves as a steward for the healthy, sustainable development of the Optimism ecosystem. As noted above, the OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. At genesis there was an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 OP tokens. The total token supply is set to inflate at a rate of 2% per year, unless changed through governance. ![|624x311]([link]) Since Aave v3 pools were recently deployed on Optimism, the use of OP as a collateral asset is the next logical step. We expect it would be the ideal home for OP pools on Aave, and for it to drive large amounts of volume to these pools. A strong bond between Optimism and Aave is a benefit to both communities. To fully realize this integration, OP would need to be added as collateral. Risk Analysis.

{"prompt":"Post: [link] ~~~ On November 21st, we posted a Request for Comment 5 on a series of proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process. Thank you to everyone who has provided their comments! Based on community feedback and discussion, we are making some adjustments to our proposal. We will keep this proposal outstanding until next Wednesday December 14th, at which point we will post a Snapshot poll on the changes. The changes to the RFC based on feedback are as follows: Revisions and updates to RFC. Increase the new \"Request for Comment process to be a minimum of 7 days rather than our originally proposed 3 days. We agree with Alana Levin 2, GFX Labs 1, and others that a minimum of 1 week ensures that the community will have adequate time to digest each proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback. Increase the quorum for the new Temperature Check, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to 10M UNI rather than the originally proposed 5M UNI. As pointed out by Deven Matthews 1 from Blockchain at Berkeley, 37 delegates meet the 2.5mm threshold  proposers would only need to garner support from 2 of these delegates to move to the last governance vote with a 5M quorum. Increasing quorum to 10M UNI increases the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support. We highlight two suggestion from Toby from Other Internet to 1) standardize Snapshot language, particularly by formalizing the use of \"No change rather than other more biased language in Snapshot polls, and 2) reach out to popular governance platforms where the governance process is listed to update it, if the vote passes. We are now planning to post a Snapshot Poll to vote on Wednesday, December 14th. The voting parameters will be 7 days and a 40M UNI quorum. In addition to the above changes, we also pose the following question to the community. We originally proposed that changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process be votes on through an off-chain vote on Snapshot. GFX Labs 1 brought up the point that custodians do not allow voting off-chain - which means many voters may not be able to participate in those votes. Should these changes be voted on on- or off-chain? Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Below, we provide an updated version of our original post. TL;DR. One of the goals of the Uniswap Foundation 1 is to reduce the amount of friction in the community governance process. In that spirit, today we are proposing changes to that process to improve its efficiency and efficacy. We propose the following changes to the community governance process: Remove the first off-chain Snapshot poll, and replace it with a \"Request for Comment post. The first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. We also believe two off-chain votes introduces unnecessary friction. Increase quorum for the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll in the second phase to 10M UNI. The purpose of this off-chain vote is to gauge community sentiment prior to the governance vote. We believe the 10 million UNI quorum will act as a better signal than the lower quorum requirements in the current process. We also propose to formalize a process for future changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process, like the changes discussed in this proposal. As mentioned above, we are now welcoming feedback from the community on whether these changes should be voted on through an on- or off-chain vote. If you keep your UNI at a custodian, opine below! Summary. Uniswaps governance process is a core input to the communitys ability to steward its ongoing maintenance and growth in a fair and transparent manner. The design of the process should optimize for the dissemination of information throughout the community, for thoughtful iterations on proposals, and for signaling from the community prior to on-chain votes. While the governance process put in place today has, for the most part, been successful in achieving those goals, we believe improvements can be made to reduce overhead and to enhance off-chain signaling prior to the final governance vote. These process enhancements were previously discussed in the forum here, but the simplifications were never implemented. We have decided to bring them back with minor changes. Below we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change. 1297842 65.2 KB. Current Process. A detailed outline of the current process can be found here 1. Temperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 25K UNI yes-vote threshold. Consensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 50K UNI yes-vote threshold. Governance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address. Proposed changes to community governance process. Phase 1: Request for Comment. Rename: Temperature Check  Request for Comment. Removal of Snapshot off-chain vote requirement. A minimum of 7 days before moving forward. We believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions  and not require going through the friction of one of two off-chain votes. The RFC Phase should last for at least 7 days to give the community ample time to formulate opinions on the proposal and provide feedback. Phase 2: Temperature Check. Increase the required quorum from 50K to 10M UNI. For this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing the Snapshot poll yes-vote threshold to 10 million UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final phase, while being low enough for higher quality proposals to garner enough support and move on to the final phase. As suggested by Toby, we also strongly suggest the standard usage of a \"No change option in these Snapshot polls. Phase 3: On-chain Governance Vote. No changes. Proposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process. As mentioned above, we are looking for more community feedback on this topic. In her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states \"On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes. An on-chain vote is unnecessary and requires users to pay gas, so should not be required for off-chain process changes. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy. We thus originally proposed that changes to off-chain processes be voted on through off-chain votes on Snapshot with a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum (original RFC here 5) However, GFX Labs 1 made the point that custodians do not allow UNI holders to vote off-chain, which may mean some UNI is precluded from voting on those changes. We would like more community feedback on whether these kinds of changes should be voted on on- or off-chain. Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Conclusion and Next Steps. If no new serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll on Wednesday, December 14th for the community to vote on these changes. If the Snapshot receives a quorum of 40M UNI votes, the community is indicating they are in favor of these changes. The UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and work with other platforms where the Uniswap governance process is defined to make updates as well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal outlines proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process.

These proposed changes are meant to reduce overhead and enhance off-chain signaling prior to final governance votes. The Uniswap Foundation is looking for community feedback on these proposed changes before they put forward a Snapshot Poll which would allow people to vote on them.\n"}
{"prompt":"--- title: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade. Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto. Dated: 2022-12-17 (updated) --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools. Abstract. There is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%]([link]) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45% By changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves. Due to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finances staking contract]([link]) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk. Motivation. Users are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. The three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time. !([link]]) !([link]]) !([link]]) In addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100% The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. !([link]]) Utilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45%  73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18% With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finances auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH \/ auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further. The improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from 96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units. With respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230% The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6% This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency. Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3. |Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)| | --- | --- | --- | |Uoptimal|45|80| |Base|0|3| |Slope1|7|14| |Slope2|300|150| |Reserve Factor|20|20| The below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3. |Polygon Parameter| Units | | --- | --- | | Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)| | Borrow Cap | 256,140 | Borrow Cap is calculated: (Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap.

{"prompt":"What is Pocket Network: Pocket is a decentralized RPC protocol with a permissionless network of over 45.000 incentivized nodes. This gives us the best resilience in the market with latency comparable to leading centralized providers, while being decentralized. Dapps that use Pocket Networks RPC get to own their service and the more they use it, the cheaper it gets. As opposed to other providers, rather than paying a monthly fee that is a recurring cost, Dapps using Pocket get allocated RPC service based on a POKT stake, which allows them to own their infra in a liquid way. By using Pocket, Aave will be actively incentivizing decentralization as the more traffic is served by the network, more rewards are generated, causing more nodes to be spun up for the chains in question. Rationale: We have learned that Aave currently uses a basket of public RPCs for servicing the end user relays. Team members have expressed the desire to improve this solution as it is not very stable and there are recurring problems in service from these different public RPCs. This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs. By providing Pocket Endpoints to Aaves user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level (both latency and % uptime) and contribute to Aaves decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake. We have developed a contract and method based permissioning method that will be implemented for AAVEs endpoint, so that it can only be used to interact with AAVE protocol. Proposal: We believe a good start is to provide this service with an app stake thats good for 25M relays (won't get rate limited if exceeded) and later ramp up depending on performance, user feedback and how much the DAO is willing to invest. Pocket Network would stake 118,815 POKT on behalf of AAVE DAO. This would be funded as follows: Budget: 25M Relays: $POKT 118,815. $POKT price at time of posting: $0.138 USD per POKT. Total: $16,396.47 USD. Goals: 1) Improve stability in Aaves public facing Web3 infrastructure. 2) Decentralization of Aaves front end RPC. 3) Give Aave ownership of its RPC service via owning the POKT token. 4) Further promote decentralization in the Aave and crypto communities. 5) Raise awareness of Pockets service and mission to decentralize web3 infra. 6) Encourage other projects to decentralize their infra with Pocket Network. Milestones: 1) Integration: Integration of Aave with Pocket via inclusion of a simple URL addition. 2) Onboarding\/Testing: Testing of the Pocket Network endpoint. Tech support provided by Pocket engineers. 3) Ramp up: Allocation of a certain % (equivalent to 25M Relays) of Aave traffic to Pocket Network. 4) Increase of % and Pokt stake if service is performing as desired; Proposal content in short. We propose an addition of Aaves frontend RPCs to Pocket Network, in order to solve stability problems currently experienced in the use of public RPCs (especially on mainnet), as expressed by the community. We are offering an endpoint with a stake for 25M relays that won't get rate limited and to be ramped up in a phased manner. To fund this we are asking the AAVE community the funds to buy 118,815 $POKT which will represent their service stake, allowing for AAVE to send up to 25M Relays per day.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The proposal is about adding Aaves frontend RPCs to Pocket Network in order to improve stability and decentralization.

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Midas), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy) Transfero. Transfero Group is an international financial solutions company based on blockchain technology in the Crypto Valley, Switzerland. Its objective is to connect emerging countries to the global market through a platform of financial solutions based on blockchain infrastructure, providing greater efficiency, flexibility, and access for people and businesses. Transfero also developed BRZ, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by Brazilian real (BRL), to give South Americans a reliable asset to the blockchain industry. The BRZ token is live on Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Stellar. BRZ was featured in a World Economic Forum panel in 2020. BRZ is integrated with fiat on and off-ramp (BityPreco) and crypto-card solutions (Wirex) and can be borrowed and lent on money markets (Midas) Motivation: The role of the 2brl pool is to increase the stability of BRZ (1), the on-chain liquidity of both BRZ and jBRL (2), and connect the Transfero and Jarvis ecosystems (3) Together, these 3 points allow for building a Brazilian DeFi ecosystem. 1. BRZ peg: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC back and forth at the BRLUSD Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the BRZ peg. 2. On-chain liquidity: BRZ: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jBRL or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap BRZ to jBRL and then to USDC to access the latters liquidity or vice versa. jBRL: jBRL main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jBRL minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets); this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jBRL-USDC and jBRL-ETH, but this will be for another proposal) 3. Connect ecosystems: the 2brl pool connects Transfero and its BRZ (essentially a fiat on and off-ramp for Brazilian DeFi users) to the jBRLs ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases. Credit without FX risk: borrow jBRL, swap for BRZ, then redeem BRL. DeFi on-ramp: use BRL to mint BRZ, then access yield or on-chain liquidity. Remittance: connect BRZ fiat on and off-ramp to any other jFIAT or USDC fiat on and off-ramp (we already performed payments between Brazil and Mexico and Brazil and France on the BNB Chain) A few notes: Jarvis LTD has started building a position in BAL and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80\/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same position. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools to bribe veBAL voters (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis \/ DotDot) Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield. This proposal is the first of many, as Jarvis Network is moving all their liquidity pools from Curve (stable pools) and Uniswap\/Sushiswap\/Kyber (volatile pools) to Balancer. Specifications: 1. Governance: Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (only one team member in the signers) Polygon: [hexadecimals] Ethereum: [hexadecimals] Gnosis Chain: [hexadecimals] BSC: [hexadecimals] Avalanche: [hexadecimals] Optimism: [hexadecimals] Transfero: centralised entity. 2. Oracles: jBRL uses BRLUSD Chainlink price feed; BRZ token does not have a price feed. 3. Audits: Jarvis: [link] Transfero: 4. Centralizing vector: jBRL is mainly collateralized by USDC; BRZ is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a centralized entity. 5. Market history: jBRL has been live since February 2022 (on the BNB Chain); it has traded a bit off its peg during the FTX crisis due to a too-high supply of jBRL on a money market vs. a too-low number of jBRL minted through the Liquidity Pool (the number of jBRL that you can sell in the Liquidity Pool = the number of jBRL that people has bought; so people borrow a lot of jBRLs from the Credit Line or which have been minted through the Printer, and sell them all through the Liquidity Pool, it can prevent other jBRL holders from selling jBRLs through the pool, preventing any arbitrages from happening) We have solved the issue by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. At the same time, BRZ had an issue with its peg because its primary off-chain market was on FTX, and the pool used a wrapped BRZ from Solana. Besides last weeks event, both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch (on the BNB) We have learned how to prevent these situations from happening again or fix them quickly. Two other rare cases can prevent users from buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pools (again leading to preventing arbitrages from happening), and we also know how to mitigate them (currently working on it as we speak) 6. Value: The 2brl pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.) It will be our first step toward moving our ecosystem to Balancers. Contracts 2brl Balancer Pool (Polygon): [hexadecimals] (AMP 200 because both tokens are redeemable) jBRL token (Polygon): [hexadecimals] jBRL (Polygon Synthereum Liquidity Pool): [hexadecimals] BRZ token (Polygon): [hexadecimals] Gauge: [hexadecimals]\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is a collaboration between Jarvis Network and Transfero to bring decentralized finance to Brazil. The goal of the 2brl pool is to increase the stability of BRZ, which is a Brazilian Real stablecoin issued by Transfero; the on-chain liquidity of both BRZ and jBRL (a synthetic fiat currency from Jarvis Network); and connect the two ecosystems together. This would create a Brazilian DeFi ecosystem in which users can borrow or lend jBRL without FX risk, access yield or liquidity with BRL, and send remittances between different countries using BRZ as an intermediary asset. The pool will also act as an arbitrage route for maintaining the peg of BRZ against BRL. It will be governed by Jarvis network with no on-chain governance but decisions are made through a multi-signature wallet while Transfero Group remains centrally managed.\n"}

{"prompt":"--- Title: [ARC] LDO Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2022-11-05. --- Simple Summary. In preparation for distributing incentives on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool, @llamaxyz proposes amending the 'Emission_Admin' address to enable the distribution of LDO rewards. Abstract. In collaboration with Lido, Llama seeks to distribute LDO incentives to the stMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the 'EmissionManager' contract needs to assign an owner to the 'Emission_Admin' permission allowing LDO rewards to be distributed, [1,2] This can only be achieved via the governance process. This proposal assigns the 'Emission_Admin' permission to LDO rewards to the following address '[hexadecimals]' This address is controlled by Lido. Motivation. The motivation of the proposal is to enable LDO rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Specification. The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered. Standard practice is for the council to meet and determine the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. The 'Emission_Admin' is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The 'EmissionManager' determines the LDO 'Emission_Admin' and not the stMATIC Reserve. The 'Emission_Admin' can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool. Implementation.

{"prompt":"Author: mialalala2321. GotchiID: 10138. Dear fren, I'm Mialalala, a longstanding participant of the Aavegotchi community especially in Asian market. I am writing to express my delight at the recent developments within the community, particularly with the unveiling of the 2023 roadmap, which has ushered in a new era of vibrancy and growth. However, with the increase in community members and the decentralization of the entity, which will increase the complication of the operation and disclosure, I believe that it is now necessary to establish a DAO steward role to manage \/ disclose the treasury balance changes and governance data regularly. This will not only ensure transparency and accountability in the governance of the community but also provide a clear and concise entry point for new members to understand the DAO structure, including the treasury and governance. Therefore, I propose that we consider the creation of a DAO steward role, which will be responsible for overseeing the management of the treasury and promoting good governance practices within the community. This will enable us to build a more robust and sustainable Aavegotchi ecosystem that is better equipped to meet the needs of our growing community. What're the responsibilities of the DAO steward team? The DAO Steward Team will be responsible for the following: 1- Building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile\/Dashboard. Aggregating basic information and social graphs, and converting them into a DAO profile. Mapping the treasury addresses of the DAO and its associated parties, including sub-DAOs or DAO departments. Analyzing the evaluation of the treasury assets, including fungible tokens (FT) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) Tracking the inflow and outflow of assets. Aggregating governance data, including proposals, voters, votes, and more. Tracking the approved proposals and keeping a record of fund consumption. 2- Generating Monthly Treasury Report. The status-quo of the treasury assets including FT and NFTs (balance sheet) Monthly assets inflow and outflow. The Status-quo of governance (data about proposals\/voters\/votes; Approved proposals and rejected) Follow-up and feedbacks about the old approved proposals. Publishing and sharing the report in Aavegotchi discord monthly. As one of the early members of Aavegotchi, we hope to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. We are thrilled to see so many active DAO adopters and players in the community already. We believe that more and more fresh blood will contribute to DAO, and that such a community will become more and more dynamic and creative. We hope that our contributions and plans, along with our request for a one-time grant of 7200 DAI and a monthly reward of 2500 DAI, will be considered. Grant can be issued all at once, while the monthly rewards can be released each month. To better test and verify our work, we propose a trial period of 6 months for the DAO Steward role. Our Team Structure: We will apply for this position through the entity team called ThePASS, which is a senior team focused on DAO treasury and governance asset exploration and research. We will allocate the following personnel and roles: | Mialalala | Project Manager | Responsible for the DAO steward team | | Muneeb | FrontEnd | | Yung | BackEnd | | Lim | UI\/UX Designer | Responsible for dashboard design and future report design | | Hakan | Content Writing | Responsible for drafting and polishing reports or other content | | Fengyun | Technology Content Writing | Responsible for talking with the DAO and team from tech side | | Di Kim | Data Engineering | Responsible for tracking the related data both about the treasury and governance | | Nina L \/ Saya Lin | Content Publishing \/ Socials | Responsible for the monthly report publishing and sharing| To sum-up, I propose the establishment of a DAO steward role within the Aavegotchi community to manage the treasury balance changes regularly. This will promote good governance practices within the community and ensure transparency and accountability. As we continue to attract more participants, a DAO steward team will be responsible for building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile\/Dashboard and generating a monthly treasury report. We are excited to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. With more fresh blood joining the community, we believe that the Aavegotchi ecosystem will become more dynamic and creative. Lets work together to build a robust and sustainable community. More information. The PASS is a DAO aggregator and treasury tracking platform. It helps build the reputation system for DAOs by aggregating the social graph (onchain+offchain) and track, analyze, and evaluate treasury assets including FT and NFT assets, giving the communities a better and more transparent way to dive deeper.

{"prompt":"Title: [ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market. author: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz. created: 20-08-2022. Simple Summary. In response to Tribe DAOs proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Abstract. Tribe DAO is dissolving the DAOs assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI. As FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEIs circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market. In response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO. This proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn. Motivation. With the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state. The details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here]([link]) As FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets. Specification. The recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Risk Parameters: Freeze the FEI market which will: Borrowing Enabled  Disable. Lending Enabled  Disable. Also, Reserve Factor 20%  100% Next Steps.

{"prompt":"| Status | Pending | | --- | --- | | Discussion Thread | [Discuss]([link]) | | Votes | Pending | Abstract. We propose that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop]([link])) be allocated in recognition of past and ongoing work of these core contributors. ENS is one of the most successful projects built on Ethereum, and yet core protocol contributors do not benefit in any way from the success of projects being built on Ethereum. The Protocol Guild provides a vehicle for the ENS community to distribute governance tokens to those individuals who build and maintain the foundational infrastructure that ENS relies on. ENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Specification. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Split Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [Protocol Guild twitter]([link]) Context. 1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all, \"Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow to 150 over the course of the Pilot. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ![|602x387]([link]]) 2022 Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year \/ $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round for longer vesting periods. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Proposal. We are proposing that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop]([link])) be sent to the [Pilot vesting contract]([link]) deployed at [hexadecimals]f1a9 in recognition of the past and ongoing work of these core contributors. The tokens would not be liquidated, but would vest for one year to each beneficiary listed on the underlying split. Each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. The USD value of the 200k ENS is $2.49mm as of the time of this post on May 25 2022. This is roughly in line with what we have already proposed to similarly prominent Ethereum-based protocols. [Lidos 2mm LDO contribution]([link]) was worth $2.6mm; the [active Uniswap proposal]([link]) requesting 500k UNI would be worth $2.75mm. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the ENS community: ENSs long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients. Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to ENS allows protocol contributors to engage more with ENS governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to delegate them within the ENS governance framework. ENS should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the ENS communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. We hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between the ENS community and the Protocol Guild as we scale up the project after the Pilot. To that end, we think its important to demonstrate impact: learn more about how we intend to evaluate [Pilot outcomes here]([link]) We have also adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we operate the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, better transparency, etc. Transactions. <table> <tr> <th>Address<\/th> <th>Value<\/th> <th>Function<\/th> <th>Argument<\/th> <th>Value<\/th> <\/tr> <tr> <td rowspan=2>token.ensdao.eth<\/td> <td rowspan=2>0<\/td> <td rowspan=2>transfer<\/td> <td>recipient<\/td> <td>theprotocolguild.eth<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>amount<\/td> <td>200000000000000000000000<\/td> <\/tr> <\/table>\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The proposal is about allocating 200,000 ENS tokens to core contributors of the Ethereum protocol.

{"prompt":"--- [ARC] - ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral. Status: Discussion. Author: @llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham. Created: 24-10-2022. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves. With the support of the community, Llama will develop ERC4626 strategies that enable Balancer v2 and Curve Liquidity Provider tokens to be deposited as collateral. Users will earn the rewards from the respective Aura Finance and Convex Finance gauges whilst being able to draw a loan against the productive strategies. This new type of collateral is expected to drive borrowing demand for listed assets and generate additional revenue for Aave DAO by sending 5% of the earned rewards to the DAO. Introduction. To support the continued growth of Aave, new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market. Llama proposes onboarding productive assets that are supportive of enhancing capital efficiency through unlocking new utility for user funds. Currently, there is $4.4B deposited in Convex Finance and Aura Finance, and when Optimism enabled liquidity mining on Aave v3, Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave increased almost 13x from $36M to $460M. Llama seeks to create the new type of collateral standard and onboard the first BPT and crvLP as collateral on the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. The new collateral type will be listed with SupplyCaps in place, borrowing disabled, and eMode created to shape how users interact with the new pools. Motivation. To understand how this strategy works, we will first walk through an example that demonstrates the user experience. In this example, the user deposits a BPT into Aave and claims rewards generated by the Aura Finance Gauge. ![|602x137]([link]) The use,r having already invested in a Balancer v2 Liquidity Pool, deposits the BPT into the Aave Reserve and receives back aBPT. The Aave Reserve receives the users BPT and deposits it into an Aura gauge. The rewards generated from staking the BPT in the Aura Finance gauge are claimable by the user without needing to redeem the BPT deposit. When the user claims the rewards, 5% are sent to the DAO and 95% to the user. The productive strategy can also be used as collateral.This creates much more utility for BPTs as users can then borrow against the productive strategy. Apart from levered farming of rewards, users can create buy-now and pay-later strategies that utilize future incentives to pay back the loans. This also creates an opportunity for other communities to build automated strategies that manage rewards and collateralization ratios for users that further streamlines the user experience. ![|602x235]([link]) The DAO can decide if pools such as Balancer Boosted Aave Pool (bb-a-USD) and future GHO pools, (bb-a-USD \/ GHO) can be listed as collateral. Leverage in this application would exhibit similar recursive behavior to that which is occurring on Optimism and could lead to significant volumes of GHO entering circulation over time. If this was to occur, it would have a positive effect on the DAOs revenue. It is important to note that, although this proposal mentions Balancer and Aura Finance, the same concept applies to Curve and Convex. The initial deployments are to utilize Aura gauges, with a Convex integration to follow. Next Steps. A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral. If the community votes positively for the development of the upgrade to enable the new type of productive collateral to be onboarded, Llama will set about designing and creating the upgrade. Llama will commit to following best practices and working closely with other stakeholders within the community in developing the new collateral type. In the lead up to deployment on the Aave protocol, further governance approval will be required. In the future, the community will also be able to decide via Snapshot whether to provide retroactive funding to reimburse the cost associated with the auditing of the new collateral type and how much funding to provide. A separate Snapshot proposal will emerge where the initial asset listing will be proposed, with contributors such as Gauntlet and others potentially playing a role. Upon agreeing on the initial asset to be listed and whether audit costs are to be reimbursed, an on-chain vote will be submitted for governance approval to transfer funds and introduce the upgrade. This loosely follows the methodology presented in the GHO proposal. Conclusion. This ARC is focused on introducing and getting community feedback on introducing Aaves newest productive collateral to the protocol. We look forward to hearing community feedback on all aspects of this proposal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about introducing a new type of productive collateral to the Aave protocol.

{"prompt":"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX \/ CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

{"prompt":"Simple Summary. This proposal seeks to modify 1inch Fusion to allow all five of the top resolvers to fill orders during the entire duration of the Dutch Auction. Abstract. If passed, this proposal will change the way that 1inch Fusion orders are filled by allowing all five resolvers to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction. This change will increase competition amongst resolvers and ensure that users are getting the best rates. Motivation. Currently, the top five resolvers are given fill priority according to their Unicorn Power. For the first minute of the Dutch auction, only the resolver with the highest Unicorn Power can fill the order. Then, the resolver with the second most Unicorn Power joins them for the second minute, and so forth. This proposal will foster a more competitive auction by giving all resolvers equal priority. This proposal aims to increase competition amongst resolvers and thus provide better rates for users when they make swaps via the 1inch Network. Specification. This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the Fusion logic to allow all five resolvers to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction. !([link]) Above is the existing Fusion auction order structure. Below is the modified Fusion auction order structure that this proposal calls for. !([link]) Rationale. Allowing for pure competition amongst the five resolvers, rather than giving preferential access based on staking power, will facilitate better swap rates and faster execution times. This change will also make it more attractive for professional market makers to become resolvers, which may lead to a greater demand for 1INCH token as they accumulate the necessary Unicorn Power. Considerations. 1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal will have no negative security implications as it will only change the structure of the Dutch auction. An increase in the number of resolvers participating in the Fusion auctions should reduce the likelihood of resolver collusion.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about modifying 1inch Fusion to allow all five of the top resolvers (which are determined by their amount of Unicorn Power) to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction. This means that instead of giving preferential access based on staking power, all five will be given equal priority and competition amongst them will be encouraged. This should result in better swap rates and faster execution times for users, as well as encouraging more professional market makers to take part in the Fusion auctions, which may increase demand for 1INCH tokens. Security concerns should not be an issue since this is only changing the structure of the Dutch auction and no new code needs to be deployed.\n"}

{"prompt":"--- title: [ARFC] CRV Interest Rate Curve Upgrade. Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting, @dydymoon and @scottincrypto. Dated: 2023-01-11. Revised Date: 2023-01-31. --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to update the CRV interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3, and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools. Abstract. The CRV SupplyCap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 24.66% with a Utilization of 47.76% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1] This proposal intends to increase the CRV SupplyCap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves. Capital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, increasing the Slope1 and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the reserves. Motivation. With the CRV reserve on Polygon reaching its SupplyCap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the SupplyCap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand. Llama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 70% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves. !([link]]) !([link]]) Specific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 70% will lead to an increase in the BorrowCap, which is a function of the SupplyCap and Uoptimal parameter. BorrowCap = SupplyCap (Uoptimal + 0.1) The new SupplyCap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24K. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 900.19K, [2] With borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments. ![|602x220]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 24.66% on Polygon v3. !([link]]) This proposal recommends introducing a Base and increasing the Slope1 parameter to 3% and 14% respectively. This will lead to a substantial change to the current curve. However, the current borrow rate still exceeds the borrow rate at the Uoptimal utilization point. Over time, we will be able to monitor the reserve and amend the Slope1 parameter t to optimize for utilization and revenue generation for Aave. The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. !([link]]) The Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments. Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.

{"prompt":"Summary: This proposal is to add a veBAL gauge for the new DOLA\/USDC stable pool on Ethereum. Pool deployed [here]([link]) Gauge deployed [here]([link]) References\/Useful links: Website: [link] Documentation:[link] Transparency: [link] Github Page: [InverseFinance]([link]) Communities: [Discord]([link]) Defillama: [DOLA: TVL and stats]([link]) Protocol Description: Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community. Inverse DAOs core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation; On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finances \"Fed contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans. Via injection\/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA\/FraxBP through our Convex Fed, DOLA\/USDC on Velodrome, and previously DOLA\/bb-a-USD on Balancer. Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using The Stabilizer. DOLA is not \"algorithmic and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA. Motivation: This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA\/USDC stable pool. Inverse has previously obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV\/DOLA]([link]) 50-50 pool and DOLA\/bb-a-USD 50-50 on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Following the recent unwinding of the DOLA\/bb-a-USD LP due to a vulnerability with the implementation of our pool with the bb-a-USD pool; we are once again looking to build deep DOLA liquidity on Balancer. Platform BAL incentives would also help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. If approved, we expect to continue what was previously done for DOLA-bb-a-USD for our new veBAL gauge and are in coordination with various bribing platforms to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative. The Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA\/USDC stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would once again begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer. Specifications: You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs]([link]), [governance]([link]) and our [transparency]([link]) pages. Governance: Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA\/FraxBP[Curve]([link]) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here]([link]) Equally, check out our transparency portal [here]([link]) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance. Oracles: Inverse Finances new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its wETH market. Inverse Finances old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable. Audits: As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest]([link]) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault]([link]) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners]([link]) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed]([link]), [Aura Fed]([link]), and [Velo Fed]([link]) In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product]([link]) Their report can be found [here]([link]) The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the teams formation can be found [here]([link]) Centralization vectors: Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work.

These are: Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management. Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market. Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.

Through the \"Feds, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLAs Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLAs peg YTD. ![[image]]([link]) Currently, the deepest liquidity pool for DOLA stablecoin is DOLA\/FRAXBP on Curve, with a TVL of ~$28m at the time of writing.

{"prompt":"Summary. The DAO is seeking approval for a change to the current compensation framework, which puts more weight on the timely delivery of projects. Motivation. The compensation framework outlined in [OIP-102]([link]) has served the DAO well over the past 6 months. However, we believe there is room for improvement. Due to the overall market sentiment and events that transpired in this year, the OKRs, most of which were market-driven, have not been met. These OKRs were meant to be difficult, but the main issue we found was that the contributors couldn't directly affect them and thus felt unmotivated when it was clear the market wouldn't allow us to reach them. The proposal below outlines how we plan to tackle that problem, as well as ensure timely completion of projects that are in the best interest of Olympus and its community. Proposal. Bonus. Instead of the current OKR-based bonuses system outlined in OIP-102, allow for a total bonus budget of $1,000,000, to be paid in (g)OHM. This budget would be allocated to projects submitted by the DAO to the community for approval, with the requisite that in 2023 there are at least 3 projects passed by the community and with a maximum bonus per project of $333,333. All DAO contributors above an average contribution level of 4, active in the DAO over the course of a project and at bonus payout would receive their share of the bonus allocated to that project at the end of the calendar year. The contributors bonus share would be weighted based on the average contribution level over the course of a project. As long as projects are completed within a month of the deadline (deadline + 1 month), the bonus for that project would be paid out in full. After that point, the bonus would start to decay on the following scale. In addition, for the Council members and Strategos (department leads), given their lower base compensation compared to the role, introduce a potential bonus of $120k per person, to be distributed only in the case of successful and timely (deadline + 3 months) completion of all projects that passed a community vote, again, no less than 3 over the course of 2023. In the case of completed projects that had their bonus decayed due to not meeting deadlines, but no more than 3m past the deadline, take the weighted average of the bonus percentages to calculate the percentage of $120k that has been earned. This compensation structure is meant to align the compensation with the responsibilities of the department leads, responsible for their respective departments, and the Council, responsible for overseeing the whole DAO operations. Projects. Projects that unlock bonuses must be deemed high-impact projects and will be submitted to a community vote via an OIP. Each project proposal must contain a description of the project, definition of what constitutes project completion and a deadline for which the DAO will be held accountable for. Along with the project spec, it must contain the bonus allocated to it for timely completion (100%) In the extraordinary case that, after the initial project proposal to the community, a project deadline needs to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances or better solutions\/improtvements are found, or a project needs to be deprioritized or canceled for justifiable reasons, the contributors would need to request this from the community and provide a detailed explanation in a OIP forum post. Base Compensation. Up until now, the DAO has worked within the limits outlined in OIP-102 - a $370k monthly base compensation budget, with an allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $462.5k. Given the proposed introduction of project based bonuses, as well as a more efficient DAO today, we propose that the monthly base compensation be reduced to $280k, with the same allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $350k This is a 24% reduction in the monthly base compensation budget. !([link]) Legal. We predict a legal budget of up to $200k will be needed for 2023. The law firms will be assisting Olympus with the following: - Evaluate potential compliance improvement areas. - Identify any proposed risk mitigation steps to be taken by Olympus to comply with applicable law and regulation. - Evaluate legal requirements that mandate, and\/or prudential risk mitigation considerations. - Advise Olympus with respect to the design of any compliance programs, and preparation of appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls integral to such programs, for presentation to the Olympus Community. - Prepare summary recommendations(s) describing the proposed risk mitigation steps, and compliance programs to be implemented, for approval by the Olympus Community. Audits. As outlined in [OIP-98]([link]), the community approved a yearly audit budget of $500,000. This is just an allowance and does not mean the DAO will need to spend the full amount. Services, Subscriptions, Other Operational Costs. The estimates for subscriptions and other operational costs are based on historical data. Services and service providers (simulations, risk analysis, etc.) are variable and not included in this budget framework. Instead, they would be listed in the quarterly report. 2023 Budget. The budget below is the projected maximum, with maximum spend in all categories (not including potential budget flex of 25%) and full bonuses unlocked. !([link]) The DAO currently holds 1,559,510 OHM worth $15,454,744, visible [here]([link]) The spend for 2022 can be found in our Q4 report available on the [Transparency page]([link]) In the case that market conditions change and the compensation needs to be adjusted in order for Olympus to stay competitive, the Council would propose an amendment to the community for approval. The Council also reserves the right, outlined in [OIP-91]([link]), to approve urgent expenses, including but not limited to security-related expenses, tooling costs, contracted services. These expenses must be detailed in the quarterly report. If this proposal passes, it would nullify and supersede OIP-102.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about changing the current compensation framework in Olympus DAO, so that more weight is placed on the timely delivery of projects.

{"prompt":"[PR with Payload]([link]) Summary This is a proposal to enable a bb-a-USD gauge on Ethereum. Protocol Description The Aave Protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol that is deployed across many EVM compatible networks including but not limited to Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Polygon. Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $5 Billion. Motivation This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for bb-a-USD. Bb-a-USD was the flagship boosted pool for Balancer. However, whilst Balancer recently launched new pools on Aave V3 to ensure continued payment of protocol fees, the bb-a-USD pool wasn't migrated and was later wound down as it was built on Aave V2. Initially, there was no migration support for Aave V3, which has been deployed on Ethereum since 27\/01\/23. Now that USDT is listed on Aave V3, as shown by this proposal, it is possible to add the bb-aUSD gauge through [this proposal.]([link]) Specifications 1. Governance: AAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal]([link]) 2.

{"prompt":"Summary. Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet. Proposal. Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top notch scalability; built-in on-chain reputation through the Matrix Reputation Power System, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum. The Metis Layer 2 utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereums underlying security. As of right now, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitaliks proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a, first of its kind, Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollups security with plasmas scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next 2 verticals. Our second vertical is the Matrix Reputation Power System, a web3 identity system providing a framework to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain reputation: portable and composable reputation earned through on-chain achievements and history. As we all know, in traditional settings and Web2, our data is not ours; Matrix changes this. Soulbound tokens will also allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren't previously available for Web3. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 companies looking to transition to Web3 without facing a huge UI change. Third, our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework, for seamless onboarding of Web2 onto Web3. DAOs have been crucial for our space, but they lack a clear structure and the right tools to make them suitable for Web2 organizations. DACs, on the other hand, will allow Web2 organizations to tailor these to their preference. By combining DACs and our Polis Middleware, Web2 organizations will have access to a repertoire of smart contract templates, allowing them to deploy without the need of code: seamless, tailored Web2 experiences. When combining all these components, we will allow dApps, Web2 apps and organizations, and\/or TradFi to enjoy a seamless onboarding experience and manage their day to day operations in a decentralized and immutable way, while taking advantage of the functionalities provided by on-chain reputation, and the scalability provided by the base Layer 2. The perfect suite for dApps, web2 platforms, or any builder. Committed to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can support projects in 3 main ways: -Builder Mining Rewards (Secured) -Ecosystem Grants (Application\/Approval based) -Genesi DAC Investments (Application\/Approval based) The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants \/ retroactive funding practices) As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting Decentralized Finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets to support the Web3 economy we are building towards. We believe that with Metis-Aave integration, these foundations can be built in a decentralized and scalable way, secured by Ethereum, and welcoming for Web2. Through this integration, AAVE can also generate an extra revenue stream while ramping up its expansion to up and coming Ethereum Layer 2s. Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future in Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a surging DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing\/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aaves multichain expansion. There are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from, including Builder Mining Rewards, EVM Equivalence, our Smart L2 architecture, and a healthy mix of native and multichain protocols like LayerZero, Hummus, MaiFinance, Hermes, and much more. Metis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity, while securing the Andromeda and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network. Metis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about integrating Aave V3 into the Metis Andromeda Mainnet, a decentralized Ethereum layer 2.

{"prompt":"Title: [ARC] Change Admin role of Optimism and Arbitrum V3 markets. Simple Summary: Aave V3 Arbitrum & Optimism markets are currently governed by the Community Guardian, a 6\/10 elected multisig of 10 Aave community members with the responsibility to enforce community decisions on snapshot on-chain. This ARC intends to replace the community guardian in favor of Aave governance contracts for the administration of Arbitrum & Optimism V3 markets. Motivation: As cross-chain governance bridges received recent audits and in favor of more decentralization of Aave, this AIP intends to fade the community guardian role in Arbitrum and Optimism V3 markets in favor of Aave governance contracts. This means that if this AIP is validated by Aave governance, every AIP concerning the Arbitrum and OP markets will require an On-chain AIP vote to directly modify the Aave V3 markets on these networks for example onboard a new asset or change an asset risk parameters. The community guardian multisig always has been presented as a temporary solution in the wait of a cross-chain messaging solution allowing the Aave governance contracts to enforce directly onchain with no trusted intermediary for the governance decisions. Fading the guardian role is a step forward in Aave protocol decentralization. if this AIP gathers governance approval, the community guardian will keep an \"emergency failsafe role with the ability to freeze markets or cancel AIPs votes to protect the Aave markets in case of crisis or malicious AIPs. The cross-chain governance bridge contract that allows more decentralization of the Aave protocol has been audited by ChainSecurity and Certora, and a report of the audit of this contract can be found in the technical link section of this AIP. Technical specifications: The cross-chain governance bridges is a set of smart contracts that serve as an extension of the Ethereum Aave Governance, receiving the approved actions by the community in Ethereum, and executing them in the target chain. The details of the actions are described in a message which is passed from the L1 Aave Governance Executor contract using the native messaging mechanism of the chain: For Arbitrum, via creation of a retrayable ticket in the Arbitrum Inbox contract on Ethereum. For Optimism, via sending a message using the OVM L1 Cross Domain Messenger contract on Ethereum. The recipient of the bridged actions are the governance bridge contracts. Once actions reach these contracts, they are registered in the execution queue so they can be executed after a delay period. Queued actions are susceptible to being canceled for a period of time (e.g. grace period) by the Guardian. This is an \"emergency failsafe, a mechanism to protect the market in the target chain in case there is malicious or illegitimate action. This is a last-resort instrument that can be used by the Community Guardian Multisig. A detailed specification of the contracts and workflow is outlined in this repository. Technical Links.

{"prompt":"Simple Summary Mimic is a platform for DeFi automation. By deploying custom Smart Vaults, it can transform centralized manual work into trustless automated actions. Recently, members of the ParaSwap DAO have proposed to implement a Fee Redistribution mechanism as part of their [PSP 2.0 proposal]([link]), in which assets accrued as fees would be converted to a native chain token (eg. ETH), and then distributed between stakers and the DAO treasury. In the current version of the proposal, there is no automated solution for this mechanism. We propose that Mimic Smart Vaults could be used to automatically convert accrued assets into the desired token. Mimic Smart Vault could be deployed in each different layer ParaSwap is in to automate how ParaSwap collects, converts and distributes its protocol fees. Context: About Mimic Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and\/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative Smart Vaults concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs. Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults. ![mimic_paraswap]([link]) Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked on many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP, and The Graph. Goals Currently, ParaSwap DAO collects protocol fees in seven layers: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum and Optimism. Assuming that the ParaSwap DAO decides to implement the fee redistribution system proposed in PSP 2.0, We propose to provide ParaSwap DAO with a solution to automate how it collects and distributes its protocol fees to assist with the implementation of this system. To accomplish this, Mimic will deploy customized Smart Vaults owned by ParaSwap DAO, one on each layer. All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when each token reaches a pre-determined value in USDC. Collected PSP and wrapped native chain token will not be converted. Collected chain token will be wrapped All other tokens will be converted to wrapped native chain token. Finally, once a month, those collected tokens will be automatically withdrawn from Mainnet Smart Vault to a ParaSwap smart contract to distribute back to their token holders. Also, it is essential to mention that at all times, the DAO has full ownership and control of all Smart Vaults assets. This means that, for example, at any moment, it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself. Means There will be seven Smart Vaults - one per layer: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions. Some of which will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that ParaSwap DAO designates. Those actions are: - Gather and swap: Gathers assets (except from WETH and ETH) from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and swaps them to WETH (except from PSP) - Gather and wrap: Gathers WETH or ETH from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and if ETH, wraps it into WETH. - Withdraw monthly: Withdraws WETH to a ParaSwap smart contract. - Withdraw: Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner. Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code. Actions won't be allowed to perform any other logic (More information here: [[link]]([link])) In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowments objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. Following the current implementation of PSP 2.0, all smart vaults could initially gather and swap into WETH, and the assets could be bridged to Mainnet for redistribution. If the DAO proposes to implement staking on any of these chains in the future, the parameters of these vaults could also be changed if needed. Metrics: Operational Details 1. Reporting Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 2. Maintenance Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults daily, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will use its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. If a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, the Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes. 3. Fees Mimic will charge a 2% fee for the assets processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD monthly cap. Fees will start at 0% and increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% after a year of execution. 3. a. Test Period The first six epochs of the Mimic implementation will be considered a pilot period to assess the effectiveness of the solutions implemented. After that, fees will increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% (always with a monthly cap) 4. Termination As mentioned before, ParaSwap DAO will fully control its Smart Vaults and the funds deposited into them. This means ParaSwap DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the ParaSwap DAO, will never be in control of those funds. 4. Audit Initially, Mimic Smart Contracts have been all privately audited. They were recently audited by Verilog and no critical issues were found. Currently, they are being audited by Certora. More information and full reports here: [[link]]([link]) Implementation Overview Once the final details of the ParaSwap Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility for setting up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case. Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by ParaSwap DAO, setting seven Smart Vaults for it shouldn't take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process just for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn't take more than one week.

{"prompt":"Background. Stargate currently uses MPT (merkle patricia trie) ([link]) in its LayerZero configuration as a validation library. This directly impacts gas cost paid to the relayer by Stargate and the end user sending a transaction. Stargate currently uses the newest ULNv2 validation library ([link]) that launched on September 5, 2022. This has been in production for over 4 months and has seen $2,203,933,589.46 volume pass through Stargate along with 1,501,174 messages over LayerZero. During the time Stargate has been using this LayerZero released a new validation library called Featherproof ([link]) which is actively used when interacting with Aptos. Featherpoof has been used in production for 4 months, has seen 185,448 messages go across it. Featherproof secures large applications like CAKE, BTC.b, and TheAptosBridge and offers a drastic reduction in gas  reducing gas costs by over 20% Gas costs have commonly and repeatedly been brought up as one of the largest limiting factors of the current Stargate implementation, this would be a massive improvement in that. Proposal. Stargate should adopt Featherproof. This would result in a bare minimum cost of 20% less gas in all transactions and in certain edge cases (such as aggregators) can result in more than 90% less gas cost. A more consistent and significantly cheaper gas cost will make Stargate more usable, more frequently utilized within all third party routing, and offer a significantly better user experience to all. Execution. A configuration change to the relayer Stargate uses would need to happen for this to be enabled. Stargate will need to select Featherproof as its validation library rather than ULNv2. This can be done near immediately after this proposal passes. Success. If successful, Stargates gas usage will decrease by at least 20% This will give Stargate an edge in an a bridge landscape that is growing more competitive over time. It will also improve user experience when interacting with Stargate by lowering the amount paid by the user. Upon success, Stargate will become significantly more competitive in the overall landscape for gas pricing and will reduce gas usage of at least 20% Reducing gas cost will also improve user experience, rate of inclusion in aggregators, and generally reduce friction on the end user by a meaningful amount. Summary. Stargate will migrate to the more gas efficient validation library Featherproof for all cross-chain transactions resulting in a significantly decreased cost to the end user and a more competitive Stargate experience.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is suggesting that Stargate switch to using Featherproof, a new validation library, instead of the one they are currently using (ULNv2) This change would result in significantly lower gas costs for end users sending transactions through Stargate and increased competitiveness in the bridge landscape.

{"prompt":"Summary. Gitcoin is the worlds largest implementer of quadratic funding. We have run 105 quadratic funding rounds, helped fund over 3,700 projects, and grown ecosystems like Uniswap, Polygon, and ENS. Yet, we aren't currently using quadratic funding ourselves. With the recent launch of the Allo protocol, Gitcoin should be one of the first ecosystems to use the protocol to fund its shared needs. This proposal is to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds for rewarding efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by Gitcoin Citizens 2. Citizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of the DAO. Running these rounds will lower the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determine what the community values most, and help test (dogfood) the Allo protocol. For this we are requesting a total of $95K in GTC from the Gitcoin treasury, more details below. Abstract. Through using our protocol and products, we'll be able to better understand what works and what could be improved from both a funding and technology perspective. In particular, we'll be able to test two different approaches to quadratic funding: normal QF and retroQF. Normal QF (the kind we see in Grants Rounds) can fund both completed and planned work, while RetroQF exclusively funds work which has already had an observable impact. Because of this, RetroQF may be better at distributing funds according to the value actually created by a contribution but is not suited to situations where contributors can't afford to wait for compensation. We will try both methods to gain information about which is better suited to the unique needs of our community. By running different styles of rounds repeatedly and quickly, we'll be able to gain valuable insight into how to best fund grantees, improve our products, and empower our community. We will also identify what contributions our community finds valuable so that in subsequent rounds people have more information when choosing what to work on. Full details can be found on the governance forums listed below!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is suggesting to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds that will reward efforts that support the Gitcoin Community.

One of the notable design V2 decisions is the introduction of the \"Bunker mode\" Lido Analytics and Tooling teams collaborated to provide [deep research]([link]) & analysis of the conditions under which it should be switched on or lifted. Security audits & checks. To ensure the security of such a big change in the on-chain and off-chain code, Lido V2 is getting a significant amount of security audits: 1. [Sigma Prime]([link]) auditing the updated dc4bc version designed for the [hexadecimals]->[hexadecimals] Withdrawal Credentials rotation ceremony. 2. [ChainSecurity]([link]) audited the Staking Router code. ChainSecuritys work will be used to find out potential weaknesses of the new crucial protocol part before merging it into the final protocol upgrade code. The audit report is published [on github]([link]) 3. [Oxorio]([link]) is conducting a cover to cover audit of the protocol with enabled Ethereum withdrawals code base in February-March. 4.

{"prompt":"Author: Maxicrouton1596 GotchiID: 24877 Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days XP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voters wallet. Discourse Thread: [link] Important note: Currently there is $38M of DAI in the curve contract, 30% more than when sigprop went live, so we are asking for a bit more funds than in sigprop ($4M increased to $5M) This increase allows us to increase the liquidity on the DEXs a little more and not end up with cash intended for liquidity that would end up lying idle. Hello Frens! The core proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25\/25\/25\/25% split is likely to pass. One of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery. At the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the impermanent loss risks when the curve will close. The liquidity provision will be split in 2 plans: - Pre-curve plan: Ensure high liquidity for the curve transition. - Post-curve plan: Buyback (protocol rewards), DAO treasury management, liquidity reallocations after price discovery. In the sigprop we had asked to secure $4M for the pre-curve plan while having fairly approximate plans, so after discussions with Balancer and Quickswap we are coming back with a more detailed plan. This core-prop only discusses the pre-curve plan to ensure liquidity on DEXs. We have a liquidity target of around $5M+, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage. PRE-CURVE PLAN: DEXs: Quickswap and Balancer. BALANCER LIQUIDITY PROVISION : We have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmys 110k) To add DAO liquidity, we chose an 80(GHST)-20(Stable) type pool. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, this type of pool looks quite interesting. To use 950k DAI in the Balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.50: 80-20 pool: 2560000 GHST (4,750,000$ pool total) This liquidity injection must occur 3 days before the close of the curve. Bribes program: It is possible for the DAO to deploy 6M DAI (this number depends on the number of DAI at the close of the curve) on Balancer and earn 5% (~300k annual) + 5-6% BAL rewards. (For the rest of the calculation we will take the worst case: 5% APY total on the DAI => 300k$\/year) Then we can use the 300k+ in DAI rewards to bribe the 80-20 GHST-STABLE pool, giving the DAO more rewards. This allows us to yield on our treasury and not let it sleep without yield. Bribes are done via Snapshot, which will require regular participation between our Snapshot DAO and Balancer. QUICKSWAP V3 LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM : To achieve the liquidity target, we believe that a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO is worthwhile. We are targeting $3M+ in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require 160,000 GHST in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $4 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program must begin 3 days before the curve closes and last for 2 months. We expect between 10% and 20% of the GHST amount in Quick rewards from Quickswap team for the liquidity mining rewards on their V3 (full range liquidity) For technical reasons, we cannot add all these rewards to the existing GLTR staking contract. So liquidity providers will have to choose between the GLTR rewards and the GHST + Quick rewards. So, to summarize, we are asking the DAO to add 2,560,000 GHST with the 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury to a 80-20 Balancer pool. This pool will be bribed by the DAO through treasury management thereafter. This provision of liquidity by the DAO will allow the DAO to earn swap fees and BAL rewards thus obtaining more cash flow. In addition to these numbers, we are asking the DAO to sponsor a Quickswap LM program with 160,000 GHST. Doing a liquidity program can be smarter in high volatility times because a 50-50 pool is very prone to impermanent losses, and we prefer incentive liquidity rather than having the DAO lose money through IL.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is asking the DAO to provide liquidity for the Curve transition in two ways: a Balancer pool with 2,560,000 GHST and 957,000 DAI; and a Quickswap V3 Liquidity Mining program with 160,000 GHST. The Balancer pool will be bribed by the DAO to maximize rewards. Incentivizing users to provide liquidity through the Liquidity Mining program will help ensure that there is enough liquidity available as new entrants enter into Aavegotchi without suffering from high slippage or impermanent losses when the curve closes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Overview. Over the course of the day on 09\/27 the BloXroute ethical relay was receiving and returning bad blocks to validators from one of our block builders running an experimental build strategy that resulted in missed slots. This builder was improperly committing transactions and caused improperly formatted blocks. Because the relay was not simulating blocks from known builders these blocks were getting sent to validators causing them to miss slots due to proposing blocks with improper receipts or log blooms. A total of 15 slots were missed due to this issue. BloXroutes relay was not simulating blocks from internal builders and was instead relying on these builders to submit valid blocks. This was resolved: The experimental builder was taken offline and ensured that it was no longer submitting blocks to any of our relays. All of the validators who missed slots were paid for the bids they received from the bloXroute relay. On 09\/30 all of the relays now simulate all block submissions regardless of source. While transferring funds to bloXroutes builder to pay for the missed slots the builder considered the transfer of 11 ETH as an MEV tip for the validator and paid that 11 ETH to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault on slots [4791729]([link]) and [4792026]([link]) Proposal.

This proposal will upgrade Aave DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar. Rationale. Adopting the EIP-4824 standard will enrich the on-chain information availability of Aave governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the Aave governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, DAOhaus, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of [DAOstar One]([link]) Note that adopting the standard does not require any parameter changes to Aaves existing DAO contracts, nor is there any cost besides gas to call the factory contract. To make the process easier, we have already built and deployed 4824-compliant subgraphs for the component endpoints of 'daoURI', including 'membersURI', 'proposalsURI', and 'activityLogURI' What remains is for Aave to claim these off-chain endpoints via the on-chain process specified by EIP-4824. The proposal does not in any way change the way that Aaves governance works.

{"prompt":"Summary. Deposit $77M DAI into the the DAI Savings Rate Earn Strategy. Motivation. MakerDAO recently increased the DAI savings rate (DSR) to 1% as a result of the revenues earned by their Real-World Asset (RWA) activities. Olympus Treasury being one of the largest DAI holder, should take advantage of the new savings rate to increase its revenues. Risk Assessment. The DSR contract has been live since November 2019, was audited by Trail of Bits, has held at its peak usage over $350M of DAI holders assets and to this date has not suffered any exploit. This makes the Dai Savings Rate smart contract one of the oldest and most battle-tested set of code in the Defi ecosystem. Due to the time in production and significant TVL over time the DSR contract is seen as a low risk contract by the treasury team. The allocator contract is developed by Olympus, and is an adapted copy of the same allocator contract that is used for all other treasury assets held in allocators (Fraxswap, CVX, Aave etc) The Olympus allocator has been used for a long time with significant value. The risk of asset loss is seen as low by the treasury team. However, this specific allocator deployment is not audited and therefor we suggest that the significant treasury reserve deposit is done in two tranches. It is proposed that a first deposit of 1M DAI is done to encourage potential exploit of the allocator contract. After 2 weeks this is followed by the main deposit. How Does the DSR work? - Dai holders can lock their Dai into the DSR smart contract at any time. Once locked, Dai continuously accrues to the users balance, based on the current DSR. - Dai holders can earn savings automatically and natively while retaining control of their Dai. The DSR smart contract has no withdrawal limits, deposit limits, or liquidity constraints. Source: [link] In regards to Treasury assets needed to conduct market operations under RBS, note that: - Deposit and withdrawals can be done at any moment. There are no lock-ups and no fees for using the Dai Savings Rate. - Twice the total of DAI used by RBS for the last completed month will remain unstaked in the Olympus Treasury. Initially, the RBS contract\/ new Treasury would be replenished when\/if needed by executing withdrawals manually from the DSR contracts. Eventually, RBS contract will be able to interact directly with the DSR contract which would remove the need for an intermediary manual transaction. Execution.

{"prompt":"[Combined 2023 Week 14 Payload PR]([link]) Summary This is a proposal to add a gauge for SILO\/ETH 80:20 Pool that will serve as the base layer for Silo Finances veSILO governance module. Silo Finance has a large amount of POL in Balancer, earning incentives that are recycled through voting incentives for AURA and BAL holders to further bolster the pool liquidity. Silo Finance continues to increase its voting incentives over time as protocol revenue increases and is committed to support the Balancer ecosystem long-term. Silo Finance is a longtime partner of the Balancer DAO. Silo Finance core contributors have allocated roughly $1.4M~ of personal liquidity to the SILO\/ETH 80:20 pool to help expand the governance base of SiloDAO. References\/Useful Links: Silo Website: [link] Dev Docs: [link] Silopedia: [link] Twitter: [link] Forum: [link] Snapshot: [link] Tally: [link] 80\/20 SILO ETH Pool: [link] 50\/50 SILO ETH Pool: [link] Silo Token Address: [link] Defillama: [link] Protocol Description How does Silo Finance work? Silo Finance is a lending market that allows users to lend and borrow any asset in a risk-isolated way through the use of bridge assets. Essentially, the protocol creates an individual lending market (or silo') for each token asset and connects all markets via bridge assets that serve as a protocol-wide accepted collateral. This design creates a security benefit where an exploit taking place in one market doesn't spread to other markets like it is the case in traditional DeFi lending markets. Silo Finance Facts. - Protocol is not upgradable (contracts are battle-tested since Aug. 2022) - Non-custodial: Neither DAO or core team can ever take custody of user funds. - No multi-sigs: DAO controls limited admin functions. [link] State of $SILO liquidity Our two largest liquidity pools are Balancer 80:20 SILO-ETH and 50:50 SILO-ETH pools with total TVL ~ $2.2M. We conduct regular buybacks of $SILO using SiloDAOs revenue directly from our balancer pools, increasing Balancers fee revenue. Additionally, we use part of revenues to increase our voting incentives to BAL and AURA holders Motivation An 80:20 pool confers lower IL exposure to LPs, allowing users to maintain greater upside exposure to the base asset. The upcoming veSILO tokenomics upgrade is designed around a locked version of 80:20 SILO-ETH BPT, similar to veBAL. Having a whitelisted gauge will provide greater incentives for $SILO holders to lock tokens which will allow additional locked TVL to flow to Balancer. Specifications Governance: Silo Finance is operated as a DAO and governance decisions are completely decentralized. SiloDAO is a Cayman Foundation operating under the name of Silo Labs. Token holders create proposals, on-chain and on Snapshot, to manage funds and affect changes to markets such as replacing oracles, updating interest model settings, etc. Oracles: Silos lending markets currently use Uniswap v3, Balancer v2 and Chainlink oracles in order to read asset prices. This is required to gauge lending parameters such as LTV and Health Factors to allow liquidation of undercollateralized positions. We also have some custom Chainlink oracle implementations for assets with things like a rebasing index such as gOHM and wstETH. Users however are only exposed to the oracles that their particular market uses. Audits & Formal Verification: Our audit reports from ABDK and Quantstamp as well as a Certora Formal Verification Report can be found here [link] Centralization vectors: No, token holders are the only ones with any sort of control over the protocol but even then they are limited to only being able to update certain things like oracles, bridge assets, interest rates, LTV\/LT settings, and protocol fees. Any changes made are also locked behind a TimeLock Controller, allowing users ample time to withdraw should they not agree with the aforementioned changes. Market History: $SILO price had been seeing a lot of fluctuations given its limited DEX liquidity. We have been seeing positive price action and volume as of late as liquidity increased. Historically, the one sharp drop in token price happened as a result of the largest token holder then - large fund- going underwater in the aftermath of Terra collapse. Value: Balancer has long been SILOs liquidity hub and our 80:20 SILO:ETH Balancer pool will continue to be our primary source of liquidity for $SILO on Ethereum. Specification: Gauge Address: [[hexadecimals]] ([link]) For Pool with address: '[hexadecimals]' Capped at 2% Should be added by the DAO Multisig on mainnet. It can be added using the following call data for the addGauge function on the gauge controller('[hexadecimals]') This can be done via the authorizerAdapter after granting the proper roles as defined in the payload.

{"prompt":"Introduction. One of the biggest changes Balancer made to veCRV when we released veBAL was the use of BAL\/WETH 80\/20 BPT as the locking token instead of BAL. This has allowed BAL to have extremely deep on-chain liquidity relative to our circulating market cap, all without having to spend costly emissions on BAL liquidity incentives. Encouraging the adoption of similar ve8020 systems across DeFi is a key strategic objective for the ecosystem. This kind of locked liquidity is far more sticky than usual TVL earned from liquidity mining, plus Balancers emissions will not be the primary driving force behind users choosing to participate as the project itself will contribute their own emissions, revenue sharing, gauge voting, or similar mechanisms. While the benefits of adopting ve8020 are numerous it remains a relatively novel concept that most users are not familiar with. It will require additional dev work from projects looking to adopt this compared to single token locking. Thus I propose that the Balancer ecosystem starts a new program for incentivizing ve8020 adoption which will outline BAL grants for projects which meet certain TVL and revenue milestones. Each project must be approved by a Balancer governance vote to participate. Program Outline This program is intended to support all systems which involve the staking\/locking of 8020 BPT. ve8020 is one such system and its a convenient shorthand to use, but this program is not limited to \"ve systems only. I suggest leaving the qualifications for participating as soft requirements since its difficult to account for every possible future situation. We must carefully balance spending BAL to drive ve8020 adoption in a bear market with vaporware projects adopting it just to get paid. Some factors Balancer governance should assess for projects adopting ve8020: Project track record - has it been around awhile, is it likely to exist going forward, does it have an active community\/user base, etc. Circulating market cap and trading activity - is there a reasonable likelihood for this ve8020 to contribute significant protocol revenue for Balancer? BAL incentives should go to ve8020 lockers only, and the lock should have a minimum duration of 16 weeks. It will be up to each project to make the case to Balancer for why they should qualify. Balancer is looking for ve8020s that not only drive high TVL but also drive protocol revenue. All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL and ideally the project will provide the necessary 20% of ETH so that no BAL is sold. Proposed Milestones Upon a successful Balancer governance vote for a project to join this program they would immediately be eligible for a grant of 25k BAL. The intention is to make this program accessible to most projects with the goal of Balancer benefitting from their future growth since they're parking locked liquidity with us. The first two milestones accomplish this while the final two milestones serve to entice larger projects to adopt this standard. If all milestones are met a project stands to gain 250,000 BAL! Please note that only TVL and revenue from locked liquidity will be counted towards the milestones. In order to future proof this program against changes in market conditions the milestones are given in relation to the price of BAL. 25k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 25k BAL by 30x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds ⅓ the value of 25k BAL 50K BAL. TVL exceeds value of 50k BAL by 30x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 50k BAL 50k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 50k BAL by 100x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 50k BAL by 4x 100k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 100k BAL by 200x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 100k BAL by 4x. Using todays price of $5.50 BAL, these milestones would be the following: 25k BAL. TVL exceeds $4.125M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $45.8k 50k BAL. TVL exceeds $8.25M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $275k 50k BAL. TVL exceeds $27.5M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $1.1M 100k BAL. TVL exceeds $110M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $2.2M. As a final note, I believe it is prudent to include that once a year passes from the approval of a projects vote to be included they must present another proposal to remain in the program for another year. Failure to do so would make them ineligible for any future milestone distributions. Specification. If approved, governance will soon see applications from projects interested in this program. No immediate action is required. The goal is to establish a clear, unbiased incentives program that is easy to understand and massively scale ve8020 adoption in 2023.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about encouraging projects to adopt ve8020 systems, a type of locked liquidity that requires an 80\/20 BAL\/WETH BPT.

{"prompt":"Authors CLever Core Team. Summary Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD\/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs. In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote. Background CLever is a risk-minimized lending platform for high quality tokens such as CVX and FRAX. CLever loans are denominated in clevTokens, which are assets paired to their specific collateral and representing its future yield. clevTokens are treated as equivalent to their respective collateral by the system, so they carry no risk of liquidation and no exposure to price oracles. CLever does not charge interest on loans, but instead a fixed rate on yield harvests, which means borrowing costs do not change with any pool utilization or liquidity. CLever FRAX allows users to mint clevUSD against several Frax-based stablecoin collateral strategies, each with its own maximum LTV and independent yield. For CLever FRAX, all yields are swapped into FRAX, which is used to pay down their clevUSD system debt 1:1, then distributed via a stability mechanism called the Furnace. In order for borrowers to utilize their borrowed tokens, CLever provides incentivized swap pools pairing each clevToken with its associated collateral. Sufficient liquidity in these pools facilitates swapping with reasonable slippage, and incentives create a yield farming opportunity for LPs of liquid FRAX with a unique risk profile. Since clevTokens represent future yield rather than a pegged asset (see next section) LP pairs are correlated, limiting the scope of impermanent loss to LPs and making these farms unique in the market. clevTokens are not wrappers of their underlying collateral tokens. Instead they represent future yield generated by collateral strategies, denominated in the collateral tokens. clevTokens can only be minted against their associated collateral, and only up to the maximum LTV for each given strategy (currently 30-50% for FRAX) During bootstrapping CLever also imposes an overall borrowing limit for each strategy. These limits will be raised as liquidity grows. clevTokens can eventually all be exchanged for corresponding real collateral tokens at 1:1 via the Furnace, so they can be considered a zero coupon bond with indefinite maturity. If the furnace currently holds collateral tokens the swap is immediate, but users can deposit clevTokens to the Furnace even if there are no collateral tokens currently available. In this case, users share the upcoming harvests proportionally with any other Furnace depositors. New harvests to the Furnace are released linearly over 1-2 weeks (depending on the collateral) which creates a smooth continuous burn rate\/bond repayment and prevents timing exploits when the system is oversubscribed. The time required to convert clevTokens into their real underlying asset via the Furnace is determined by the collateral yield rate(s), as well as how many clevTokens are sharing those harvests in the Furnace. Since clevTokens represent future assets rather than current ones, they can trade at a discount representing the time value of those tokens like any bond. Borrowers swap when the discount is sufficiently small and, on the other side of the equation, users can buy clevTokens from the Curve pool to arbitrage the discount. This arbitrage can be repeatedly looped between the Furnace and the Curve pool as the Furnace converts clevTokens to their paired collateral assets. CLEV Tokenomics CLEV is CLevers native token and it uses Curves ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. CLever applies fees to the collateral token harvest yield, the majority of which will be distributed to veCLEV holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because CLEV is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue in CVX, FRAX, and any future collateral tokens. The operation of CLever makes it a net buyer of CVX and FRAX. Locking CLEV is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn a growing stable of hodl-worthy tokens. Motivation: Increasing liquidity and visibility for the clevUSD\/FRAXBP pool is critical to the operation of CLever. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways: - CLevers model directly supports demand for underlying collateral strategies like FRAXBP farms by facilitating the creation of leveraged farming positions. - CLever provides unique new farming opportunities and by creation of yield bond markets and (liquid) clevToken-collateral farming. Proposal In order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support clveUSD - Frax swaps we propose that Frax vote with 300,000 vlCVX for the clevUSD\/FRAXBP pool for the next 6 epochs on Votium.

{"prompt":"Proposal Topic. [Blockchain at Berkeley]([link]) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad]([link]) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. Process Update. The [Temperature Check]([link]) for this proposal passed with 8.3M UNI voting Yes on the [Snapshot]([link]) We now move to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote. Summary. In support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap]([link]), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswaps trusted brand. About Moonbeam. Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadots XCM]([link]), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects]([link]) building DApps and protocols on the network. Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam. We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market  Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values  decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way. Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders. The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext]([link]) have already been deployed as Moonbeams main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance. Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance. Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap]([link]), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad]([link]) and [Connext]([link]) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance. We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap]([link]) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains. Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomads own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app]([link]) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored]([link]) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam. Rewards and Grants. As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal. To borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin]([link]) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \"bounties, hackathons, and grants for \"developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner. Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: - Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam. - Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users. - Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap. - Leveraging Substrates native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain. Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences. We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant! Conclusion. We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons: - Expansion into Polkadot: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeams EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeams position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. - Trust-minimized Governance: Per Uniswaps goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomads trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future. - Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswaps multi-chain presence. We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The proposal is about deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam in order to expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n"}
{"prompt":"--- title: [ARFC] Add BAL Ethereum v3. Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consultants & @solarcurve (Balancer DAO) Dated: 2023-01-31. --- Summary. This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard BAL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. BAL is a strategic asset to Aave and any BAL earned from the pool could be used by Aave to bootstrap the adoption of GHO and\/or the new aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies. The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post]([link]) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum. By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote. Motivation. Listing BAL as a priority for Aave v3 reflects the strategic relationship between the two communities. Balancer and Aave completed a [200,000 BAL for AAVE token swap]([link]) and Aave later purchased an additional [100,000 BAL via a swap contract]([link]) With the launch of [GHO]([link])getting closer and the [new aToken]([link]) from @AaveCompanies currently in queue for audit, the potential use cases for veBAL are numerous. Due to the potential use cases for veBAL in supporting bootstrap the growth of Aave, the BAL token is considered a strategic asset. Therefore, we believe listing BAL on Aave v3 Ethereum is a priority. Balancer DAO is a large provider of liquidity on Ethereum v2 and also Polygon v3.

{"prompt":"Note: Its a a recurring proposal. Summary. A few months ago it was launched a decentralized $Opium covered-call strategy, where pool stakers can obtain a position that allows them to earn a premium (in $Opium) if the market price of $Opium is less than its strike price. The scope of the current proposal is to put forward a plan to run a liquidity mining campaign on the covered-call pool. The Opium team proposes to make the Opium Ecosystem fund an active counterparty in the $Opium option call, as this would have the beneficial consequence of further incentivising the participation in the pool. For this end, the Opium Ecosystem would acquire decentralized option calls from the covered-call pool and would fund the premiums of all the stakers.

{"prompt":"Title: Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn. Sigprop Author(s): @Yanik_ai (Gotchi ID: 4751) @AL (Gotchi ID: 10504  XP forgone as working group author) Quorum requirement: 9mn\/20% Voting Options: Yes, Implement. ; No, Abandon Mechanic Change. ; Abstain. Body: This proposal re-attempts to change kinship mechanics so that kinship points are burned during each Gotchi channeling event. Current alchemica emission trajectories forecast an annual increase of 40% in supply due to persistent increases in Gotchi kinship multipliers at no cost to the player. The proposed change is a -2 kinship point burn per each gotchi channeling event. Additionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to \"NO to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship. Some benefits of this proposal: Players will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games. Develops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility. There is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games. The specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change. Alchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets. The Graph of FUD emissions below shows the short and long-run effects of this proposal. Emissions reductions would be immediate and their impacts long-lasting if implemented. For example, after 1 year of implementation the emissions reductions is about -55% from the current trajectory & -20% reduction from a baseline of 0. ![[image]]([link]) Potential Risks: Players with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is. Less engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity. Additional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers. This work was the result of several peoples efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards. Please weigh-in on your votes below!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This proposal is about changing the way Gotchis use kinship points. Currently, when a player channels their Gotchi, they get more alchemica with no cost to them. This proposed change will make it so that players have to burn -2 kinship points each time they channel their gotchi in order for their alchemica emission trajectory to increase. Additionally, there will be a new permission setting added to Aavegotchis that allows renters to channel the Gotchis and preserve kinship points at the same time. The purpose of this change is so players are forced to think about how best to use their kinship  either burning it at an altar or saving it for other uses like rarity farming or spending in another game. It also gives players an incentive to participate in Pixelcraft efforts or use Kin Points in other games. However, there are potential risks as well such as less engagement with Aavegotchis due decreased activity and additional complexity which could overwhelm newcomers.\n"}

{"prompt":"--- title: [ARFC] Migrate & Consolidate Polygon Treasury. author: @llamaxyz. created: 2023-03-11. --- Summary. Llama proposes consolidating and migrating funds held in the Polygon v2 Collector Contract to the v3 Treasury. Abstract. The Polygon Aave v2 Collector Contract has accumulated holdings in several long tail assets over time. This proposal seeks to acheive the following: Transfer - Assets from v2 Collector Contract to v3 Treasury Consolidation - Swap GHST, JEUR, SUSHI, and DPI for USDT. Motivation. Collector Contract.

As has been widely discussed on the forum, Aave v3 offers enhanced risk management tools and presents a lower risk environment to users. Here, we propose that v2 aTokens be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury address. From the v3 Treasury address, the tokens can be deposited into Aave v3. Utilisation across the v2 deployment is low and there is excess liquidity within each reserve that enables Aaves aTokens to be redeemed without affecting users. Llama proposes migrating liquidity at the first available opportunity. There is also ongoing and soon to be expanded liquidity mining occurring on the Aave v3 deployment. Consolidate Assets. Similar to a proposal relating to the [Ethereum v2 Collector Contract consolidation]([link]), we suggest swapping all JEUR, SUSHI, GHST + DPI to USDT. The general flow of events is redeeming xSUSHI, GHST and DPI from the v3 Treasury and then swapping the assets for USDT. |Network|Deployment|Ticker|Price|Quantity|USD Value| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolDPI|$70.85|2.29| $ 161.96 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolSUSHI|$1.27|2,055.89| $ 2,610.97 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolJEUR|$1.05|2,622.03| $ 2,753.13 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolGHST|$1.04|2,788.45| $ 2,899.98 | |||||Total| $ 8,426.05 | Why USDT, Aave holds more DAI and USDC on Polygon than USDT. If Aave was to deploy liquidity into a 3pool, then more USDT would be required when depositing equal amounts of each asset into the pool. The vlaue of the assets being swapped to USDT is very small relative to exisitng stable coin holdings. Specification. The following assets held within the v2 Collector Contract are to be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury wallet. Using 1inchs Fusion in auto mode perform the following: 1. Redeem aPolGHST, aPOLjEUR, aPolSUSHI and aPolDPI. 2. Approve GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI. 3. Swap all GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI to USDT. 4. Deposit USDT into Aave v3 USDT Reserve. Fusion offers MEV protection and Cowswap is not deployed on Polygon.
