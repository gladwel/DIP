{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nTL;DR Uniswap v3s BSL expired Saturday, April 1, 2023. Post BSL-expiry, it will be beneficial to identify one official Uniswap v3 deployment per chain in order to provide safety & security for users, focused support to ecosystem participants, and clarity to Uniswap governance. This deployment would be recognized in future Uniswap governance actions, by the UF for hackathons, by the ecosystem for liquidity mining campaigns, etc. In the post below we recommend the following in order to determine and track official Uniswap v3 deployments: A governance process which mostly remains the same, with some updates to allow for the fact that deployments can now be recognized as official after they have been deployed. Creation of a new subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth that will be used to track official deployments. The creation of the new v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain requires a governance vote. We are kicking that off here with an RFC, and we will gather feedback on this proposal as a whole as we go through the governance process. As many of you know, the BSL is set to expire later this week on Saturday, April 1. Once it expires, it will be possible for any person or team to deploy the Uniswap v3 code for production or commercial use (more on the BSL here) We assume that there will be multiple deployments of Uniswap v3 across other chains. However, after the BSL expires, it will still be important for the Uniswap DAO to determine which deployment, of many potential deployments, on another chain should be recognized as the Uniswap DAOs official deployment. It will be important, and beneficial to both the DAO and Uniswap users, to identify one official deployment per chain for many reasons: Code Verification: this official deployment will have been verified as equivalent to the source code by the DAO. In other words, the DAO will have verified that no one has altered the deployment code in a malicious or unintentionally harmful manner. If for some reason the code has been altered, for instance to be deployed on StarkNet in Cairo or in another language on another chain, those changes would be vetted by the DAO prior to an on-chain vote. Ecosystem Clarity & Support: Some Uniswap ecosystem developers may want to focus their efforts on integrating with one designated Uniswap deployment per L1 or L2. Ecosystem or Foundation funded liquidity mining campaigns and hackathons will similarly look to support the official deployment. Uniswap Governance Control: Only the official deployment will be updated and maintained by Uniswap governance (ie., to add fee tiers or turn on fees) Below we lay out the process we recommend that Uniswap governance adopts to identify these official deployments. Some of the thinking around these steps were inspired by a post written by @devenmatthews a few days ago, which you might also want to read here. The governance process will remain mostly the same, with some specific changes being recommended to: Takes into account the fact that deployments may now be done prior to the Uniswap governance process being completed to identify it an official deployment. Allows the proposer to change the deployer team if they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner, or to change a bridge if the chosen bridge is hacked, prior to the final on-chain vote. Still allow for the Uniswap DAO to review and approve specific details, such as the deployment team and bridge, prior to voting a deployment to be official. Allow for the governance process to track official deployments in a newly created Uniswap.eth subdomain, v3-deployments.uniswap.eth. The on-chain vote will update this subdomain with the relevant deployment information An on-chain vote is itself required to create the new subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth, which will track official deployments of Uniswap v3 on other chains. This RFC is kicking off the governance process to do that. List of Actors in a Deployment First we want to review and clarify the types of stakeholders who participate in a cross-chain deployment. This review may be helpful in understanding not only the recommendation below but the mechanics of these types of proposals as a whole. Its possible for one entity or person to serve as multiple stakeholders at once for instance, a proposer can also be a deployer, and a deployer can be a bridge provider. Proposer: entity or individual that creates the proposal on forum, and manages the governance process Deployer: entity that handles the deployment of Uniswap v3 contracts on other chains or L2s Bridge Provider: cross-chain messaging solution selected from the Bridge Assessment Committees recommendations L1 or L2 team: target chain for deployment Proposal Sponsor: entity that has enough UNI to sponsor the final on-chain vote. The Uniswap Foundation is typically able to serve as the sponsor for these proposals. Recommended Process The governance process (defined here) will remain the same in terms of time frame, platform (forum, Snapshot, on-chain vote), and quorum requirements, with specific adjustments being made to the process for ascribing a Uniswap v3 deployment as \"official. Prior to an on-chain vote, Uniswap v3 should be deployed. During the vote, delegates should assess all components of the proposal and deployment including but not limited to a deployments equivalency to source code (potentially leveraging the help of more technical network stakeholders), and whether a bridge or bridging solution is included in the Bridge Assessment Committees set of recommendations. Deployments which pass this governance process will receive support as the official Uniswap deployment on the L1 or L2 from the Uniswap Foundation, DAO, and ecosystem. RFC: Minimum 7 days. Post your proposal on the governance forum to allow the community to review and ask questions. Keep the proposal in the forum, responding to questions and iterating upon the proposal based on feedback for at least 7 days prior to moving to the next phase. Proposal is for an official deployment on the L1 or L2, with the rationale for deploying Uni v3 on that chain. At this point, the deployment may already be completed. If so, include links to relevant contracts, and include a description of the deployment team and bridge used. If the deployment has not already been completed, the proposal might reference the deployer and bridge which are intended to be used, but this is neither binding nor required. If the deployment has not been completed already, the proposer should converse with teams interested in aiding with contract deployment. Deployers can also comment on the RFC, communicating their willingness and technical capabilities to handle deployment. Temperature Check: 5 days. Create an off-chain Snapshot Poll to ensure community sentiment is in favor of your proposal. A majority of votes in favor, with a quorum of 10M UNI votes, is required to move forward to the last phase. A Temperature Check is done, assessing Uniswap DAOs desire to have the deployment done on the L1 or L2. Again, at this point, a deployer and bridge might be determined already, but its neither binding nor required. If and when the Temp Check passes, the deployers will have confidence in Uniswap governance interest in supporting a deployment on the L1 or L2. Deployment is completed If a deployment has not already been completed, it should be done following a successful Temperature Check. The proposing team can work with the deployer to execute the contract deployments. Details of the deployment, including contract addresses and messaging infrastructure, should be added to the forum in the proposal for the on-chain vote. Governance Vote: 11 days (7 day voting period) An on-chain vote is proposed and executed. If successful, the vote would add the new deployment information to the newly created v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. The benefits of this process are as follows: The proposer is not bound to a specific deployment team, if for some reason the original deployment team is unable to deploy in a timely manner prior to the on-chain vote. The proposer is not bound to a specific bridge if a bridge is hacked between the RFC and deployment. A bridge or agnostic solution should ideally be chosen based on the recommendations from the Bridge Assessment Committee. Uniswap governance still has final approval of the deployer and bridge used through the final on-chain vote. Creation of v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain As we note above, and in alignment with the governance process we recommend after the BSL expires, the UF proposes to create a new ENS subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth to track official deployments of Uniswap v3 on L1s and L2s. This Temperature Check is the second step in that process. Updates to Proposal from RFC Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the Request for Comment. We wanted to call out a couple specific points from the conversation: Naming Convention We should settle a single name for the deployments that are the subject of successful governance votes. We recommend \"canonical. E.g. the recent Avalanche deployment will be referred to as the canonical Uniswap v3 deployment on Avalanche. Non-EVM Deployments For non-EVM deployments, @devens Starknet post is a good starting point. There has been some conversation around conventions for audit requirements and we hope that continues. This proposal is not meant to define the exact process by which those deployments will happen, but I do think that audits from a reputable firm (or firms) that are familiar with the Solidity codebase would be a signal that a given deployment should be taken seriously (and a lack of those audits should be a symbol as well) Verification of Deployments For EVM deployments, a standardized verification process that can be performed by anyone and the results of which can be found publicly (and be interpreted by a variety of audiences) should absolutely be the norm. Much like the audit process mentioned above, the presence or absence of these test results will be a valuable signal to delegates when they vote on a deployment. I joined the Foundation 36 hours ago but this topic has already come up in several discussions and I'm excited to help move it forward. Next Steps Code Pending a successful Snapshot vote, we will move forward with an on-chain vote that: Creates a new subdomain ('v3-deployments.uniswap.eth') Edits the text record of that subdomain to the protocol name and bridge sender contract address of all deployments that were granted BSL licenses Other Output Following a successful onchain vote, we will update the forum guidelines for posting with the recommendations contained here.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about creating a process to identify and track official Uniswap v3 deployments across different chains.

All of the shortlisted applicants have confirmed their desire to join the Lido on Polygon operator set in the public onboarding thread. During the discussion, the LNOSG was cognizant of potential market volatility and the impact to existing Lido Node Operators currently running validator for the protocol as a potential result from increasing the set size from its current six members. The proposed shortlist balances the goals of the LNOSGs diversification efforts on Polygon while working to limit rewards dilution for existing Node Operators.

The Zunami Protocol integrates directly with Curve/StakeDAO/Convex smart contracts by providing liquidity in pools. Zunami utilizes an Omni pool to rebalance and diversify user funds. The current set of strategies is approved by DAO vote and consists of XAI/FRAXBP, ALUSD/FRAXBP, and MIM/3CRV.

Kinship has been a part of Gotchi lore since the first one was summoned from the first portal and has been a part of Rarity Farming beginning with season 1. With kinship being the basis of how channeling earnings are calculated AND also being a Rarity Farming category, it makes channeling one of the most difficult to really balance. We don't want to nerf owners by further affecting their earning by targeting kinship but we really need to address the long-term effects channeling poses to the economy. So I propose that we the DAO adjust the base channeling rate and put a cap on the max that a gotchi would earn, or simply put a cap on the multiplier earned thru kinship, at a number the DAO would vote on at a later date. This way a gotchi would naturally come to this set number without affecting RF because kinship itself would still rise normally. This would leave other options more viable for kinship use, for instance, mini games or other areas. Doing this we the DAO could help slow emissions without needlessly hurting gotchi owners. I propose doing this in 2 stages: The first would be a vote to see if the DAO members are interested in pursuing this. If both the sigprop and coreprop pass, we continue to the second stage. The second would be a separate sigprop requesting that the DAO fund a bounty to have a third party model, for example, at least three (3) different kinship cap levels to see when at least 60% or perhaps 65% of the channeling gotchi will reach that point, the daily and/or weekly emissions projected before and after the caps are reached. I would open a new thread on the topic to get more input from the DAO on the various parameters that should be included in the modeling. FIRST STAGE The initial proposal is to: Change the base channeling rate from the current 20 FUD, 10 FOMO, 5 ALPHA, and 2 KEK to 15 FUD, 7.5 FOMO, 3.75 ALPHA and 1.4 KEK To install a toggle on Gotchi listings to turn channeling On/Off with the default set to Off. POTENTIAL BENEFITS The changing of the channeling base rate would amount to 25% emissions reduction for FUD, FOMO and ALPHA while giving a 30% emissions reduction to KEK. FUD total channeling is ~472k-FUD would drop to ~354k FOMO total from channeling is ~239k-FOMO would drop to ~179k ALPHA total from channeling is ~120k-ALPHA would drop to ~90k KEK total from channeling is ~48k-KEK would drop to ~33.6k {Numbers are current as of 4/7/2023} This change would immediately target emissions directly rather than a \"quid pro quo mechanic that is dependent on player actions. This is not meant to be immutable. I envision the DAO having the ability to adjust the base channeling rate along with the multiplier or channeling cap based on the economic situation in the future. This should take very little DEV effort to implement and would not negatively affect Rarity Leader boards by intermingling it with daily tasks . Both low kinship gotchi and newborn gotchi will still be able to gain kinship and a cap is easily understood by new players being that caps are very common. Allows space for kinship to be utilized in other areas; for example mini-games and crafting. A toggle would help future proof lending when kinship could be used while the gotchi was being rented. POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE The decreasing of the channeling base rate would reduce earnings but with the plan move to the Gotchi Chain the fees to channel will be minimal and the DAO could re-examine spillover rates being that it does not affect emissions.

The aim of this proposal is to slow down long-term emission effects while minimizing the effects felt by Gotchi owners such as reducing earnings from channeling and not affecting Rarity Leaderboards through daily tasks mixed in with it. If passed, DAO members can still vote in the future on spillover rates or adjust cap levels based on economic situation at any time."}]}

To kick off an election, any BanklessDAO member can post a [formal proposal]([link]) to check the level of support to hold a vault multisig signer election. This proposal must have a poll which passes the [Minor quorum thresholds]([link]) 2. When the formal proposal reaches quorum, the member may then post a Forum post to gather candidates. In this post, candidates must provide evidence that they meet the eligibility requirements. This proposal must stay up for at least one week. 3. After one week, the veracity of each candidates eligibility evidence must be validated by the member who posted the proposal. This member will then post the final candidate list in a comment on the proposal. 4. The current vault multisig signers must then post a token-weighted poll on Snapshot with the list of candidates specified above as well as a list of the current vault multisig signers as options (barring any signer who wishes to step away from the role) This poll must stay open for at least one week. 5. The seven candidates with the highest proportion of support will become the new vault multisig signers. The current signers must take the steps to add/remove members as needed to ensure the group of vault multisig signers reflects the will of the DAO. Removal of Vault Multisig Signers Vault multisig signers can be removed if: 1. a vault multisig signer has violated any of the mandated responsibilities. 2. any member in the DAO gathers consensus via Forum on the no-confidence state of a vault multisig signer or the vault multisig signers as a whole. There is no term limit for vault multisig signers, however continuation in the role is subject to the community vote. EXPECTED IMPACT This change will mean the DAO has adequately documented procedural information about the role of a BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signer. It is anticipated that if enacted, this update will be followed with an election for a new team of BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers. ANALYTICS After this bDIP is ratified, we hope to hold an election to increase active multi-signature wallet signers from 2/7 to 7/7. NEXT STEPS Achieve Minor quorum to add bDIP to Constitution, then run an election.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary This OIP establishes a new framework for the DAOs treasury, covering the following categories: Guiding policy Target treasury composition Asset allocation process Strategic Assets The DAO should reevaluate the framework from time to time, accounting for evolution of the protocol and changes in the market. Guiding Policy The Olympus treasury is at the very core of the protocol and the DAO and, combined with novel monetary policy, makes OHM unique. The long-term sustainable management of the treasury is essential to OHMs success. Yet, we must also recognize OHMs growth will be driven to a far greater extent by true demand and utility rather than treasury management alone. Our strategy will reflect this reality by focusing on conservative deployment as opposed to active and aggressive investments. Furthermore, it will be consistent with Olympus' ethos of decentralization, favoring organic third party proposals and scalability to ensure the framework is compatible with an on-chained governed future. The treasury team may devise and propose strategies but ultimately intends to spend more time shepherding and vetting proposals from the community, DAOS and service providers. Target Treasury Composition Recommendations Asset Mix: The treasury is currently composed of approximately 79% stable assets and 21% volatile assets. The RFC preceding this proposal recommended an increase in volatile exposure to 25%, providing Olympus with a stable base for open market operations (RBS) while maintaining sufficient market correlation and upside. The vast majority of comments to the RFC were focused on this ratio, with most recommending or requesting a more aggressive shift toward ETH and other volatile assets. However, given the current state of the protocol and nature of RBS, the Treasury team maintains the 75%/25% recommendation. Still, especially in light of the USDC depeg, the Treasury team recognizes need for Olympus to decrease reliance on stablecoins with centralized backing. Increasing ETH exposure marginally is one step in that direction while not undermining the relative stability of OHMs backing in the near term. The other step is increasing exposure to purely decentralized stablecoins. The Olympus Treasury has generally limited this exposure to 5% of respective supplies. In order to facilitate further decentralization, the team recommends increasing the cap for LUSD to 10% while maintaining a hard cap of 5% for its counterparts with centralized backing. These two steps together will reduce exposure to centralized stablecoins by more than 10% or approximately $25 million as of this writing. Looking forward, as Olympus matures, garners more adoption and as evolved versions of RBS are deployed, the DAO should reevaluate these ratios to determine whether it is feasible to increase decentralized exposure. This may include increasing ETH exposure or introducing more purely decentralized stablecoins as they become available. The Treasury team recommends this reevaluation be done every six months. In terms of execution of the 75%/25% split, the transition should be complete within 60 days of the passing of this OIP. LUSD exposure will be increased opportunistically, as it approaches parity with DAI/FRAX/etc. Rebalancing: The target weights should behave more like bands, rebalancing when weights deviate more than certain thresholds from targets. The Treasury team recommends rebalancing bands for volatile assets between 20% and 35% Custom strategies, including improvements to RBS, may be created to automatically rebalance and a dashboard will be created to empirically monitor and measure positions against their target weights. Protocol Owned Liquidity Mix: The Treasury Team recommends rebalancing the OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pool sizes to better match broader treasury target ratios. As of this writing, there is approximately $16 million DAI and $20 million ETH deployed in POL pools. While the treasury team recognizes the importance of the pool, it recommends reducing the OHM/ETH pool by $10M (and possibly increasing the OHM/DAI pool) to mitigate IL and to increase capital available for LSD or other ETH opportunities. ETH liquidity may be supplemented with BLE vaults and/or other third party liquidity. Maximum Protocol Exposure: Limit exposure to any protocol / project to 60% of the treasury. For reference, DAI accounts for 50% as of this writing. This would still apply to protocols with multiple products e.g., exposure to FRAX and frxETH would cumulatively be limited to 60% Asset Duration: Limit deployments into illiquid venues to 7.5% of the Treasury. For purposes of the ultimate proposal, illiquid is defined as a maturity or lock-up greater than 4 months. In no event shall the treasury deploy into assets with maturity or lock-up greater than 1 year, with the exception of select strategic assets acquired via DAO swap or other similar arrangements, which today include FXS and JONES. Asset Deployment Process Baseline Deployments: The treasury team will recommend baseline strategies for each asset or group of assets. Baseline strategies should carry little to no incremental risk over holding the underlying asset. Yields on base strategies should serve as a hurdle rate for other opportunities for the DAO to evaluate. Through past OIPs, baseline strategies have emerged as follows: DAI: DAI Savings Rate Staking FRAX: FRAX-USDC base pool on Convex LUSD: Stability Pool There is no baseline strategy for ETH today. The treasury team recommends deployment of ETH into liquid staking derivatives or similar products. Asset Deployment Applications: It is our hope that the treasury team spends most time not writing proposals, but rather vetting and shepherding deployment proposals from others. The ETH baseline strategy should serve as a great test case, as we invite proposals from the community, LSD protocols and other stakeholders to engage. With respect to other assets, we expect the baseline strategies to cover the majority of holdings but that leaves ample room for other deployment opportunities. The treasury team has developed an objective intake and vetting process, and will work with initial applicants to iterate and establish best practices. Applications should be consistent with the treasury guiding policy, prioritizing security and decentralized processes above chasing highest returns. Applications will be evaluated along the following criteria: Protocol history Strategy risk Smart contract risk (including audit history and oracle reliance) Protocol governance Expected returns Strategic benefits Today, treasury deployments are done through a custom system of allocator contracts that interact with the treasury. In the future, we intend to develop an \"allocator SDK allowing third party proposals to come complete with an allocator that can plug into Olympus architecture paving the way for a decentralized treasury management system that is compatible with on-chain governance. Protocols, service providers and others who are interested in making a proposal to the community can reach out here. Strategic Assets The treasury team will recommend target levels of strategic assets for governance purposes. Once achieved, additional rewards will be sold into stablecoins or ETH depending on the current ratio. With respect to voting, the treasury team will make intentions clear for each asset, providing certainty to the market for a given period of time.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about establishing a new framework for managing the DAOs treasury.

Background zkSync is a zk rollup, a trustless protocol that uses cryptographic validity proofs to provide scalable and low-cost transactions on Ethereum. zkSync Era is made to look and feel like Ethereum, but with lower fees. Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM. zkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities. Era provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work. Motivation The Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSyncs v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity. zkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users. Contributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: \"EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network. Additionally, ecosystem developers note \"zkSync will further Aaves expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aaves place as the top liquidity market.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nThe HOP token is extremely illiquid in its current state, with liquidity fragmented across Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon and Ethereum mainnet. To make matters worse, this liquidity is scattered across several different DEXs, including Uniswap V3, Camelot, Velodrome, Quickswap and Sushi. Even whilst using a DEX aggregator, liquidity is still too thin to buy or sell without experiencing dangerously high slippage, significant price impact, and has even resulted in users commonly becoming sandwich attack victims. Crypto protocols use several different tools to increase liquidity depth for their token holders, including: utilizing their own token emissions to reward on-chain liquidity providers, working with external HFT firms and centralized exchanges to ensure a listing of the asset, or bribing' governance token holders of prominent DEXs to vote their own emissions in the favor of the stated protocols token. It would be fairly easy to deepen liquidity if the HOP community were to choose a single chain in which the token was traded. The Hop Protocol treasury currently holds 826K OP (~$1.9M) and 1.67M ARB (~$2M) If 10% of these treasury assets were redirected to HOP/WETH liquidity providers over the next 12 months, the annualized yield would be upwards of 45.8% at the current level of liquidity ($850k) While its difficult to estimate the precise impact on notional liquidity added from this rewards program, it would likely be material. This proposal is aimed at allowing the HOP community to choose which networks and DEXs should be targeted and prioritized for improving HOP liquidity conditions. Below are examples of four high-level approaches that could be implemented to accomplish these goals. 1. Bribe existing DEXs with OP and/or ARB to incentivize the redirection of protocol emissions towards a particular HOP LP Pool (i.e. HOP / WETH on Velodrome) This solution requires the least amount of technical development and will only require bi-weekly multi-sig transfers of either HOP, ARB or OP. 2. Build an LP staking contract and integrate it directly on Hops front end. HOP LPs of a specific pool who stake their LP tokens in this contract will be rewarded with a predetermined percentage of the ARB and/or OP mentioned above. This may require allocating ~10% of each treasury asset to maintain liquidity on both Arbitrum and Optimism, which also allows the protocol to stick to its multi-chain ethos. 3. Working with a third-party automated liquidity management provider such as Arrakis Finance to develop HOP / ETH vaults emitting liquidity incentives in the form of OP or ARB. 4. Creating a Nitro Pool on Camelot Exchange (Arbitrum Only), which would allow a simple distribution of any chose incentive token (likely ARB) to HOP liquidity pool participants Deepening liquidity for the HOP token will provide a better and safer experience for HOP ecosystem participants, while also attracting new community members. Improving HOPs liquidity should be considered a foundational requirement before any material changes to tokenomics can be implemented. The largest risks associated with incentivizing liquidity will be related to fragmenting the core development teams time and efforts. Further, selecting a single chain or DEX may seem as if the protocol is picking favorites, especially after the Hop community received OP and ARB allocations. The above issues could be mitigated to an extent by the provided solutions within this proposal.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about improving liquidity in the HOP token.

Abstract: This proposal outlines a plan to offboard Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1 and encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. Motivation: Aave V1 has been an essential platform in the DeFi ecosystem, but with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is necessary to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. Offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions will ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem. Specification: The offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1.

Users can utilize Stargate to transfer value between various supported blockchains taking advantage of guaranteed finality for their transfers, low fees and deep liquidity. Developers can enable omnichain experiences within their products by utilizing Stargates deep liquidity and easy composability. Stargate operates using only native assets across each of the eight chains it supports (Ethereum, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Metis) Users will always receive native assets when interacting with Stargate, getting rid of the need for wrapped assets or IOUs of value. Stargate has helped facilitate over $4,500,000,000 of value transferred by over 1,000,000 transactions within the first year since launch. Portals are an ideal fit for Stargate as it combines one of the most used and liquid third party bridges that has a strong track record of moving value with one of the most respected protocols and communities of users in Aave. Stargate would enable Aave users to reliably and safely access assets on a variety of chains in a secure and trusted manner. Stargate would like to request a credit line for USDC, USDT and ETH to help Aave users access these assets in a multi-chain world. Technical Specifications Stargate operates with deep pools of capital on each chain it resides on. Currently there is over $325,000,000 of value within Stargate that facilitates hundreds of millions of dollars of monthly volume and tens of thousands of monthly users. Over its lifetime, Stargate has helped over 1,000,000 users move over $4,500,000,000 of value and growing. These pools of capital allow users and developers to move value between supported chains in a predictable and reliable way. When this is combined with Stargates Instant Guaranteed Finality 1 it means that a transfer always completes on the destination chain with the intended amount. There is never a case where you get wrapped tokens or some notional representation of value. This is incredibly important for Portals as it guarantees that all unbacked aTokens will be repaid in a predictable and guaranteed way. To support portals, a user would simply have to deposit a supported asset (USDC, USDT or ETH) and select the destination chain where they want to receive the asset from Aave. Stargate would then use a LayerZero message to release the asset on the destination chain from Aave, giving it to the requesting user. At the same time the underlying native asset would be simultaneously bridged via Stargates traditional, battle tested liquidity transfer mechanism based on the pools of capital within the protocol. When this transfer completes, the native assets would be used to repay the outstanding debt from the Aave aTokens Stargate was lent to facilitate the transfer. ![[image]]([link]) Stargate is built on top of LayerZero. LayerZero is a lightweight universal messaging interface that allows developers to seamlessly interact with contracts across dozens of blockchains. LayerZero Endpoints rely on an innovative architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and independent Oracles and Relayers to securely relay messages between chains. ![[image]]([link]) Communication flow in a single LayerZero cross-chain transaction. In a single call, paying only source gas, users and protocols can send a message (or a bundle of messages) to contracts on any supported chain. Stargate uses this messaging to facilitate the movement of value (stable coins, ETH and other assets) between the eight chains it supports. These chains are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche and Metis. Can anyone provide liquidity to the protocol? Yes Is liquidity incentivized? Partially, Stargate owns a portion of the liquidity within the protocol, providing predictable, evergreen underlying liquidity to the protocol and incentivizes the remaining liquidity Is there a fee model for participants? Stargate currently charges 6 basis points per transfer plus the cost of the gas associated with sending the transaction through the LayerZero network Does the entity is or is planning to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol? Stargate currently is exploring research ideas around depositing idle liquidity into Aave Link to analytics dashboard of protocol (Liquidity, assets, networks, volume) [link] [link] 1 (community built and maintained) If applicable, link to the user-focused dapp of the entity. [link] Link to technical documentation [link] Credit Line Request Stargate would like to request credit lines for the blockchains where both it and Aave exist. These are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Fantom. We understand Portals will start primarily between ETH and the layer 2 ecosystems (Arbitrum and Optimism) so would like to request credit lines there first, with the ability to scale to the other chains as Aave scales Portals. This way Stargate can grow with Aave as a partner. |Network|Asset|Current Liquidity (USD)|Current 30D volume (USD)|Requested credit Line|Fee Model|Fee requested| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |All|USDC|90.2M|242M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps| |All|USDT|54.3M|100M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps| |All|ETH|22.7M|68M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps| Incentives An incentive program may be approved by the Stargate DAO after the proposal is approved. The Stargate Foundation will recommend that the Stargate DAO give 2 bps of every transaction to the Aave DAO to help align economic incentives and create a deeper partnership between the two communities. Audits & Security List of relevant security audits of the network Stargate both internally and externally audits all code that is shipped for the protocol. Stargate works with external auditors like Zellic, Ottersec, and Ackee to ensure user funds are always safe. A list of audits can be found here: [link] Stargate also utilizes LayerZeros PreCrime solution to ensure that it never loses a single unit of user funds. Pre-Crime takes an outbound transaction and makes sure that its legitimate by running it against a set of application-defined invariants before the delivery of each message. Pre-Crime first forks every chain locally then it runs the state transaction locally to make sure the resulting state meets the list of defined invariants the application sets. Once this is confirmed Pre-Crime then provides an attestation that this is a legitimate transfer and the message is delivered. ![[image]]([link]) Has the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? on which Networks?

Context & Goal At the time of the V2 roll-out, a rewards claim limit was added [[PSP 2.0 Renaissance - Social Escrow, Fee Redistribution, and Fairdrop - Governance Proposals - ParaSwap DAO]]([link]) The purpose of this limit was to : To maximise the interest of stakers in their investment, by requiring them to be present on the protocol at least every 3 epochs in order to claim their income. Pre-empt the $ETH revenues that arrive on DEAD wallets so that the DAO can put them to good use. The first epoch showed that the mandatory quarterly claim had the effect of greatly diluting the ROI of the smallest investors. Indeed, with modest bags, the obligation of a quarterly profit withdrawal drastically reduces the returns of our investors. The DAO is not intended to suck returns but simply to ensure that the ETH generated by the protocol are not lost forever on DEAD wallets. We therefore propose to extend the claim period to 6 or 12 epochs so that everyone can, if they wish, wait until they have enough in their \"yield account\" to claim. After this period, the DAO will exercise its right of first refusal on the rewards as initially stipulated in the 2.0 proposal Forward-thinking consideration If this proposal is accepted, it will allow all forms of portfolios to come and take advantage of the social escrow and its returns without difficulty.

As a leader in the global hacker movement, Dora provides crypto-native toolkits to help developers around the world raise funding and build. To date, 30+ major blockchain ecosystems have already adopted Doras infrastructure (hackerlink.io / dorafactory.org) for quadratic funding, community contribution, hackathon, bounty distribution, and governance of their developer communities. By far, 2200 projects in the DoraHacks community have received over $20 million in grants and contributions from supporters worldwide. In over two years since launch, Frax has been able to establish themselves as one of the protocols teams in all of DeFi. Although the core team only counts in the single digits, they have been able to propagate an ecosystem of stablecoins and subprotocols. The question remains though, if we want Frax to reach the heights comparable to Ethereum and beyond, how can we cultivate a community to build on it? Fraxbuild is the first official hackathon endorsed by Frax Finance. The event will be online and hackers will have 50 days to submit their applications. The goal of this hackathon is to increase dev awareness of building on Frax, promote the creation of products and primitives that complement the Frax ecosystem of stablecoins and primitives, as well as educate developers about how they can integrate Frax into their protocols.

It features 10 000 Luchadores NFT, each of which can be played in the game. ![lucha-banner|69[hexadecimals]](upload://[image]) Since the start, the Luchadores team has adhered to a \"purist ideal: the NFTs are fully onchain (svg art), attributes were allocated with provable randomness thanks to ChainLink VRF, and the game itself will live onchain too. A flash of Luchadores history Luchadores NFT - _mint_init 17/05/2021; mint_end 18/08/2021_ The Luchadores NFT were launched on 17 May 2021, with 10 000 Luchadores mintable for 2 LINK (VRF price) + gas costs in ETH. It took about three months for the full collection to be minted, with a sizable interest spike as the end of the mint was approaching. LUCHA token launch _23/12/2021_ In December 2021, the LUCHA token was released on the Polygon network. 6,18% of the total supply was allocated to Luchadores NFT holders over 1 year. The amount of LUCHA tokens earned daily per Luchadores NFT owned depends on their rarity. Other incentives were distributed for tournament winners (prizes), and soon to be earned in the game. ![lucha-yield|69[hexadecimals]](upload://[image]) Pi\u00f1atas _pinata_1_init: 31/01/2022; pinata_1_end: 01/02/2022_ Pi\u00f1atas are ERC-1155 NFTs on Polygon containing random accessories for Luchadores. The first round of pi\u00f1atas sold out in less than two days, as fellow Luchadores were hungry for gear. LUCHA_yield_extension ([LIP-2]([link])) 15/12/2022 The daily yield allocated to Luchadores holders was extended for a one-year period with the LIP-2 vote LUCHA_yield_clawback ([LIP-3]([link])) _21/02/2023_ & POL_strategy _24/03/2023_ ([LIP-4]([link])) 14 months after the token release, and because of the LIP-2 results, the DAO decided to redeem the unclaimed $LUCHA of the first year and use it to fund the POL strategy. 2,25% of the total supply was retrieved (over the 6,18% for the first year rewards) and allocated to liquidity and vote incentives. Tournaments To date, 3 tournaments have been organized, offering a unique opportunity for Luchadores to prove their skills in the arena. Interested players can register their Luchadores, select their desired statistics and skills, and thats it! The grids are generated randomly; the matches are played automatically, and the player can check the results of his Luchadores the next day. Luchadores who perform well in tournaments can earn pi\u00f1atas, LUCHA, accessories, and even Luchadores NFT. _VRF full on-chain game, Independent team, no pre-mint, no team allocation._ Motivation After more than one year of existence, the LUCHA token is now widely distributed; with the Fight-to-Earn component launch approaching, the team is also looking to improve the liquidity situation beforehand. Thanks to LIP-3 and LIP-4 votes, the total liquidity available on the pool increased massively, with the vast majority of it being protocol-owned. The LUCHA/wMATIC Balancer pool is already the main pool to exchange the token, and its importance will accrue. ![image|669x500](upload://[image]) Side/Arbitrage pools are also available: ComethSwap LUCHA/wMATIC, LUCHA/MUST; [UNIV3 LUCHA/MATIC]([link]) Additionally, the Luchadores DAO will create vote incentives on Warden Quest to attract more veBAL & other wrappers voting power while building its own strategic assets holdings. Independent vlAURA holders have also expressed their intent to support the voting on the gauge if obtained in its early days. The governance is also considering switching the LUCHA staking model to a veLUCHA one, where holders can stake (and, if they want, lock) LUCHA/wMATIC BPT tokens to earn MASK, the non-transferable in-game currency, BAL rewards, and other benefits. Specifications 1. Governance: There is no on-chain governance as the game and the token are still at an early stage. Voting via Snapshot covers treasury and token-related decisions, executed through a 2/4 multi-sig. As development progresses, the game and its related infrastructure will be increasingly on-chain (Polygon) 2. Oracles: The Luchadores do not rely on external oracles. 3. Audits: The LUCHA token is a standard ERC-20 token 4. Centralization vectors: The multisig mentioned above is the main centralization vector in the current stage. While the Luchadores NFT is built for resilience, the LUCHA token requires more guardrails until the game is finetuned and fight to earn is launched. 5. Market history: After significant volatility at first, the LUCHA price stabilized while the initial supply was being distributed. 6.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nFor more background and discussion, please see the incubation ([link]) and ideation ([link]) threads. Summary This proposal suggests the integration of UMAs oSnap module by ShapeShift to decentralize and improve the on-chain execution of ShapeShift governance decisions. Abstract This proposal recommends integrating UMAs oSnap module into the ShapeShift ecosystem to optimize and decentralize the on-chain execution of governance decisions. oSnap streamlines on-chain voting outcomes and allows DAO members to propose and execute Snapshot vote results, validated by UMAs oracle. The incorporation of oSnap will provide the ShapeShift community with a transparent, decentralized governance process, while its language-based rules offer flexibility for custom rules and upgrades. Motivation oSnap provides a way for DAOs to decrease reliance on multi-sigs and provide communities an increased role in governance and execution of governance outcomes. Specification If this proposal passes, the integration of UMAs oSnap module involves the following steps: 1. Add the oSnap module to the ShapeShift Safe through Zodiac. 2. Set oSnap parameter values for the proposal bond and challenge period. These will initially be set to 100,000 FOX and 48 hours, respectively. In the future the challenge period may be reduced if the DAO determines that invalid transactions are being caught and disputed quickly and consistently. 3. Configure the oSnap module with the ShapeShift Snapshot Space using the SafeSnap plugin by setting the 'umaAddress' value to the address of the oSnap module. 4. Snapshot proposals can now use Snapshots transaction builder to include transaction data that can be proposed and executed on-chain when the Snapshot voting period ends. Additional information and a video walkthrough on oSnap deployment can be found in the UMA docs: [link] Benefits By integrating UMAs oSnap module: 1. ShapeShift inherits UMAs network of validators who are financially incentivized to monitor and dispute invalid proposals. 2. oSnap can prevent common DAO-related issues like treasury mismanagement and delays as it optimizes for transparency and efficiency. 3. oSnap reduces reliance on core teams by handing control over to the community. Only one person needs to raise a dispute to stop a transaction that was not approved by the DAO from being executed. 4. Adding oSnap to an existing Snapshot Space and Safe is fast and free. The contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin. Drawbacks Potential drawbacks of integrating UMAs oSnap module into ShapeShift may include: 1. Depending on the length of the challenge period set on deployment of the oSnap module, this may cause a delay in transaction execution. UMA recommends a challenge period of at least 12 to 24 hours, although some DAOs may choose to make their challenge period longer. The initial challenge period for the ShapeShift oSnap module will be set to 48 hours. 2. The current ShapeShift proposal process does not always strictly define the transactions to execute in advance, but a typical oSnap flow would be to create a bundle of transactions through Snapshots transaction builder, include them in the Snapshot proposal, and then simply execute the transaction bundle by clicking a button on Snapshot after they are approved. If the exact transactions for a Snapshot proposal are not defined in advance, or can not be executed all at once, this may require a more complex flow where the transactions are described in natural language and voted on, and then only after the vote concludes are the specific transactions created, proposed and executed through oSnap outside of the Snapshot interface. This might require extra work and testing to ensure that no additional risks are introduced. However, it is very similar to the current flow where transactions are usually created and executed by the ShapeShift multi-sig after a Snapshot vote. Despite these potential drawbacks, we believe the benefits of integrating UMAs oSnap module into ShapeShift outweigh any challenges, ultimately providing users with an enhanced governance experience that is significantly more decentralized and trustless than using a multi-sig. Vote For: Integrate UMAs oSnap module Against: Do not integrate UMAs oSnap module\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that ShapeShift integrate UMAs oSnap module into their ecosystem in order to decentralize and improve the on-chain execution of governance decisions.

There are potential drawbacks such as longer challenge periods or a more complex flow for transactions that cannot be executed all at once, but these are outweighed by the potential benefits. If this proposal passes, it will involve several steps including adding the oSnap module to ShapeShift Safe through Zodiac and configuring it with Snapshot Space using a plugin."}]}

Timeless hopes that by launching LIT, other projects will be able to incentivize their token liquidity at a much higher level of efficiency on Uni v3. Additionally, Timeless use LIT and Bunni to bootstrap liquidity in its own yield token markets. How does Timeless work? Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol. You can provide assets to Timeless (e.g. 100 USDC) and mint PYT and NYT (e.g. 100 PYT and 100 NYT) The assets will be deposited into a farm, and the yield earned can be claimed by the PYT holders. By holding either only PYT or only NYT, you can build either a long position or short position on yield rates such as stETH or aUSDC. How does Bunni work? Bunni is a liquidity engine that was built on top of Uniswap v3. It was initially released in October 2022 as a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Curve and Balancer. These improvements aim to: - Encourage the longevity of the protocol by disincentivizing farming-and-dumping and aligning the interests of liquidity providers and LIT holders - Provide the protocol with a large treasury to fund growth and reduce LIT price volatility - Maintain a high level of liquidity for LIT For more information about the tokenomics, please see FOO: Fungible Ownership Optimization: [link] Specification Transaction A will be executed immediately.

Abstract This proposal continues to builds on BIP-52 and BIP-163 by presenting the community the ability to migrate the Aave v2 BAL deposit to v3 on Ethereum. [BIP-52]([link]) was the first proposal to suggest depositing BAL into Aave deployments to earn yield. [BIP-164]([link]) was approved by the community and an additional 44.5k units of BAL was deposited into Aave v3 on Polygon. This proposal is focuses on migrating the exisitng 102.75K units of BAL on Aave v2 to v3 on Ethereum, plus an initial 47.27k unit of BAL brining the total deposited amount up to 150k units. An AIP will be submitted this week to list BAL on Ethereum v3 with a Supply Cap of [700k units]([link]) By migrating, Balancer DAO would make up near on 1/7th of the Supply Cap and this would be extended to 21.4% upon depositing the full 150k units of BAL. Motivation After reading the Karpatkey proposal and learning that BAL falls outside of the defined remit, we would like to suggest that BAL be deposited into Aave v3 markets to earn yield. There is currently 102.75K units of BAL, valued at $668.14K, deposited in Aave v2. This Aave reserve is frozen, meaning users can not borrow any more BAL and they can only repay existing BAL debt. The graphic below best respents our expectations of what Balancer DAO will receive by having funds deposited into an active Aave reserve. The below shows historical yield on Aave v3 on Polygon. !(upload://[image]) !(upload://[image]) Specification Upon @Llama deploying the BAL liquidity pool on Aave v3 Ethereum, Balancer DAO is to migrate the full BAL holding on Aave v2 to v3 using the migration tool developed by Bored Ghost Developing.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\n[link] Summary This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for the 80% jAURA - 20% ETH pool on Ethereum Mainnet. jAURA is an auto-compounding wrapper token of the low-cost, partner-focused, vlAURA token. As Aura launches on the Arbitrum Network, we will be using this pool to foster a familiar model that allows for ease of use and high adoption rate of both Balancer and Aura on Arbitrum. In a similar way, we plan on building upon the Balancer and Aura ecosystems through MetaVaults and other future integrations. This strategy was co-developed alongside Redacted Cartels Hidden Hand, with mentorship from Aura and Balancer. Special thank yous to: Lamentations, Json, Sami, Solarcurve and Maha for helping us through ideation and finding equity with the Aura, Balancer, and Redacted communities. jAURA provides, what we think, is a community service through its super efficient gas and retention structure as well as rebating back to the AURA team to help fund their ecosystem. Every single user who utilizes jAURA supports the AURA team. Protocol Description Jones DAO is a yield strategy, and liquidity protocol with vaults that enable 1-click access to DeFi tools. These strategies unlock liquidity and capital efficiency through yield-bearing tokens. Previously, Jones was focused solely on bringing users interested in Decentralized Options a simple, auto-pilot solution. The protocol has now expanded our focus, and explores many areas of yield generation, including Balancer & Aura. Motivation Jones DAO believes that a Jones <> Aura strategy resulting from our partnership should be viewed as a public good. As such we have streamlined retention, delegated as much voting away as possible, and kept our incentives aligned with what we believe is a best-in-class DEX; Balancer. Alongside that, Jones plans to tithe the Aura Protocol with 0.69420% of the revenue generated by the product, which will go back into sustaining the Aura ecosystem. Increasing those revenues through providing boosted $BAL rewards further increases the support we can give to the Balancer ecosystem. By delegating to Redacted Finances Hidden Hand program, jAURA also automatically & efficiently collects Aura gauge voting incentives. We want to make sure that users and the community know that incentives will always align with the Balancer and Aura ecosystems. As such, our strategy minimizes what is needed to vote for this proposed pool to ensure that depositors in the LP have adequate incentives while not overbribing or attaching our $JONES token to the emissions - this is a public good in the first order and its important to underline this as the motivator. Another very important part of the partnership is that we have chosen our LP as a direct competitor to Auras own AURA/ETH LP which, if as popular as we hope it will be, means less bribes will be necessary from the AURA team leading to slower inflation. A net benefit for ALL AURA holders. Specifications Governance: Jones DAO is currently governed by a core multi-sig and will transition some of that governance to veJONES holders when that launches in Summer 23. Oracles: Github: [link] Audits: The product has undergone internal testing using previously deployed code from our partners. It has also received multiple rounds of Audit review from Solidity Finance. Review here: [link] Centralization Vectors: The jAURA project will be run through smart contract interactions to be initiated or paused by the Jones multisig. As such there will be some governance control we retain however we have agreed to work with Aura in making the best decisions for the community. Market History: The Jones protocol has been live since February 2022. We focus on real-yield strategies involving options, arbitrage, leverage, which results in vaults that are both unique and successful. To date, we support 7 different tokens across several different strategies and as of writing, almost $40MM in TVL - [link] Value: If Balancer enables this gauge, we can expect this pool to provide exit liquidity at a reasonable cost to jAURA LP/Lockers which will be the first in a line of transparent legos for folks who want to participate in the growth of Balancer and Aura without the associated inconvenience of manually claiming and staking rewards. In the future, this strategy can also be put in place on Arbitrum. We will also be funneling revenue back to Aura, allowing them to help the Balancer ecosystem flourish and avoiding dilution events like capital raises.

In particular this is a vote to: 1. Unpause SLP withdrawals and deposits, which require technical upgrades and fixes, to allow SLP holders to withdraw the full value of their sanTokens at the time of the Euler hack if they want to 2. Settle HA positions at their cash-out value at the time of the Euler hack. 3. Ensure proper agEUR backing by swapping the proceeds of the Euler claim process (notably the ETH obtained) and some DAI to either EUROC or to USDC and EUROC. 4. Leave the Angle Core Module in a state where SLP strategies can be restarted without backing agEUR. Context Euler repaid Angle on the 12th of April ([tx1]([link]), [tx2]([link])) The protocol received: - 7408.8 ETH - 3,416,991 DAI - 263,379 USDC Should prices stay at their current levels, the protocol has enough to make all protocol stakeholders whole (including HAs and SLPs) It is is over-collateralized and will have a remaining surplus. Depending on the exact outcomes of the swaps and of the voting option chosen, it should even be in a very similar position than before the hack. The primary objective of this vote is now to provide a way to restore and maintain agEURs peg until a new, more resilient mechanism to back the stablecoin in an automated way is released. Additionally, it should provide a way for SLPs to retrieve their funds if they want to, and repay HAs. Proposal Swap Given that mostly DAI and wETH were received from the hack, this vote proposes to swap a portion or all that has been received into other stablecoins. Two options are suggested: 1. Swap everything that has been recovered plus some DAI into EUROC 2. Swap 50% of the recovered ETH into USDC and 50% into EUROC Option 1: Swap ETH and DAI for EUROC To fully cancel the exposure of the protocol to ETH and USD, the first option is to swap the 7408.8 ETH and 3,416,991 DAI received from Eulers redemption to EUROC. Additionally, this option includes removing 2,700,000 DAI from the Core modules DAI PoolManager contract to be swapped to EUROC. This is to make sure it has enough EUROC to back all agEUR issued through the Core module, while leaving enough funds in the PoolManager for DAI SLPs to withdraw their funds + outstanding profit. The exact figures about whats currently left in the protocol, and whats needed to handle SLPs, HAs and agEUR claims on the Core Module can be found[here]([link]) These EUROC will be used by the Guardian or Governor multisig to provide liquidity into the agEUR-EUROC Curve pool, allowing the pool to progressively get back to equilibrium, and agEUR back to peg. In practice, when the agEUR / EUROC price is < 0.995, this voting option will allow the Governor or Guardian multisig to use the protocol EUROC to either: - add EUROC to the pool if the total pool liquidity is < 5M, or - buyback agEUR with EUROC and burn agEUR when the total pool liquidity is > 5M The consequence of this actions should be: 1. To provide enough liquidity for agEUR price to get back to peg 2. Maintain agEUR price to peg using the protocol EUROC reserves once there is enough liquidity on the pool This would fully cancel the need for the protocol to handle exchange rate risks, and it would make all agEUR issued by the Core Module backed and collateralized by EUROC. This would also pave the way for a resilient V2 of the protocol to be released. In this option, mints and redemptions through the Core module will remain paused. Option 2: Swap ETH into 50% EUROC and 50% USDC This option is meant to only cancel the protocols exposure to ETH, and partially cancel the protocols exposure to USDC. While the protocols Core module could be technically restarted for agEUR holders redemptions after the swap, there is a possibility that the protocol does not have enough USDC immediately available to handle all agEUR to be redeemed. While the protocol could use at this point the EUROC reserves to maintain peg, the exact details of how to handle this could be decided in a future vote. In all cases as executing the swaps with EUROC on-chain would be very expensive given the lack of EUROC liquidity, the vote suggests going though Keyrock OTC desk (with Airswap) for the trades or use on-chain liquidity possibly passing by USDC. For both options, this vote also proposes the following elements: PoolManager upgrade Upgrade the PoolManager contracts to fix the accounting loss linked to Eulers hack to allow SLPs to withdraw their funds, and be able to unpause the strategies in the future, or to launch new ones. For option 1, it would also allow the governance multisig to withdraw enough funds to be swapped to EUROC. Unpause SLPs Unpause SLP contracts for Angle USDC, DAI, FRAX and wETH depositors. It would allow them to deposit and withdraw again. Strategies debt ratios will stay at 0 for now, meaning that funds won't be invested for the moment. The strategies could be restarted independently in the near future when Angle is in a more stable state. Settle HAs Settle all the HA positions that were opened at the moment of the hack at the value of their margin netted of their realized profit or loss at the time of the hack. Settlement is to be done by the DAO multisigs which should send the funds directly to the affected HAs. [Here]([link])is a list of the concerned addresses and the amount they should receive. These are computed computed by calling the'getCashOutAmounts'on the HA contracts at the block,'16818578'when the[protocol was paused]([link]) Proposal is also to keep HA contracts paused, meaning no new HAs will be able to open positions. Next steps This vote is meant to be a first step to get the protocol back on track quickly. However, and regardless of the option chosen, it is not meant to put it in a definitive state. [This article]([link]) outlines why it is important to take advantage of the learnings from the hack to build a better, more scalable, and robust system that can make agEUR a backbone in DeFi. Vote Practically speaking, the vote would approve the following: - Update the PoolManager contracts to: - Fix the accounting of Eulers hack loss, allowing SLPs to withdraw their deposit and outstanding profits - Allow for strategies to be restarted in the future - Unpause deposits and withdrawals for SLPs - Repay HAs And one of the two following options need to be chosen: Option 1 - Withdraw 2.7M DAI from the protocols PoolManager to ensure the protocol has enough to back agEUR - Swap the WETH and DAI from Euler and the DAI from the PoolManager to EUROC with Keyrock through Airswap - Allow the Guardian or Governor to manage the agEUR-EUROC pool liquidity in accordance with the details above Option 2 - Swap 50% of the 7408.8 ETH obtained from Euler into EUROC and the other 50% into USDC with Keyrock through Airswap - Settle in the future how to reopen a primary market for agEUR with the protocol If no option work, or if the vote is rejected by the majority, the proposal could be amended to find a solution thats workable for the majority. The voting options are hence: 1. For option 1, swap to EUROC, unpause & upgrade 2. For option 2, swap to USDC & EUROC, unpause, upgrade 3. Against, amend the proposal Voting timespan As the protocol is currently long ETH and bears significant exchange risk, this proposal has a timespan of only 25 hours. This allows for a quick swap to take place if the vote is successful.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about finding a way to protect Angle and agEUR after the Euler hack. The proposal suggests two options: either swap all of the ETH and DAI received from Eulers redemption into EUROC, or swap 50% of the recovered ETH into USDC and 50% into EUROC. It also suggests upgrading the PoolManager contracts to allow SLPs to withdraw their funds, unpausing deposits and withdrawals for SLPs, repaying HAs, and allowing for strategies to be restarted in the future. This vote has a timespan of 25 hours due to the risk that comes with having excess exposure to ETH at this time. If neither option works or if it is rejected by majority vote then an amended proposal must be created."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\n' Authors: Jack Melnick, Hamzah Khan. Polygon Labs ' Launch Hop on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Point of Contact: Hamzah Khan, TG: @khanHamzah, email: Proposal summary We propose to Hop community to deploy Hop Bridge protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as \"Polygon zkEVM on behalf of the community. We believe this is the right moment for Hop to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons: Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility. Additionally, speed of fraud proofs allows for near instant native bridging of funds bridge (rather than waiting seven days) An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations. A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values. Hop is already deployed on POS with good success Hop gaining market-share through early mover advantage Polygon mainnet launch went live on March 27. Our aim is to have Hop as one of our early stage bridge partners, as we view Hop as a highly crucial product for users to bridge their assets across various chains. Incentive rewards We propose to redirect 15% of the current Polygon incentives (430k $HOP 15% = 64.5k $HOP), and focus on ETH and USDC only. That will drive $1.5M in TVL which would be sizable relative to current bridge TVL on Polygon zkEVM. Incentive map below- Polygon zkEVM ETH - 32,250 USDC - 32,250 Polygon PoS ETH - 150,500 USDC - 144,050 DAI - 30,100 USDT - 40,850 About Polygon Labs Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: L2 solutions/rollups (Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Miden 1); and Sidechains (Polygon PoS) The Polygon PoS network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured. Motivation Theres significant value in Hop being available on an EVM equivalent ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Hops place as a leading DEX and a thought leader. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Hop has seen on Polygon PoS, its only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority. Partner Details Polygon Labs This proposal is being made by Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon networks. Partner Legal The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as \"Polygon Labs. Delegate Sponsor There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Hamzah Khan of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community. Conflict of Interest Declaration There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Sushiswaps legal entities, including Sushiswap, SUSHI tokens, nor investments of Sushiswap. What potential risks are there for this projects success? How could they be mitigated? Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereums core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. The bridge has been disintermediated, and Sushiswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygons zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary Deploy Arrakis PALM to create a secure Uniwap V3 oracle and get deep, concentrated liquidity on UniV3 STG. Introduction to Arrakis Finance and Arrakis PALM Arrakis Finance is Web3s trustless market-making infrastructure protocol that enables sophisticated algorithmic strategies on Uniswap V3. Since launch, Arrakis has achieved: - Around $1.7b in TVL at its peak (currently around $460m), across Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon - More than 25% of Uniswap V3s total TVL - More than 80 projects have their liquidity managed via Arrakis vaults Arrakis PALM - Protocol Automated Liquidity Management is a novel market making product sitting on top of UniV3. In essence, PALM helps protocols bootstrap their base asset inventory (ETH, DAI, etc.) as well as attain deep and sustainable liquidity. The major advantages of using PALM include: - Zero incentive: no LM incentive needed, liquidity bootstrapping is done solely via market making. - No biased price impact: PALM conducts market making by setting up ranges / limit orders, no swaps involved. - Trustless: Stargate DAO retains the ownership of the liquidity and can withdraw at all times. PALM only autonomously manages the liquidity but can never remove it. - Highly customizable: PALM can be adjusted for various asset types and purposes beyond just liquidity bootstrapping. PALM has been deployed for a growing number (15) of protocols and is performing exactly as designed. To see a thread explaining these metrics and the performance of the GEL vault, you can have a look at this thread: [link] You can also read about how this vault has performed in extremely volatile situations here: [link] Background & Motivation: Recently, the Stargate team has expressed the intention to integrate STG into other DeFi protocols, namely Radiant and other lending protocols such as Euler Finance, where STG can be used as collateral on the lending platform. The UniV3 TWAP oracle is one that is accepted by various permissionless systems. In order for this oracle to be healthy it requires a liquid UniV3 market, the more liquid the less manipulatable it is. A good bench mark of the oracle risk can be calculated as the cost of moving the TWAP by 20% both on the sell and buy side. Using this system, the current minimum cost of moving the UniV3 TWAP of STG by 20.89% is about $24k over 1 block, which makes it easy to manipulate. ![image]([link]) The primary cause of the low cost of attack is the Uni pools low liquidity and liquidity distribution. For instance, CAW, a random token just for comparison purposes, has less liquidity than STG on UniV3, but a significantly higher cost of attack due to the structure of the liquidity. ![image]([link]) ![image]([link]) ![image]([link]) For this reason, we propose that Stargate use Arrakis PALM to manage its liquidity on UniV3, which will help STG create a secure oracle, and also bootstrap deep liquidity for STG on Uniswap. Specification Stargate DAO creates a 1% fee tier UniV3 pool for STG/USDC. Arrakis then deploys a dedicated vault managed by PALM for the pool. Stargate DAO deposits $500k worth of STG and $500k worth of USDC into the vault. PALM will allocate 50% of that liquidity towards a full price range and utilize the other 50% in a concentrated and fully active market making strategy. The primary objective is to create a robust UniV3 oracle for STG. Yield Estimating yield from LPing is very difficult since it depends on volumes, volatility and the amount of liquidity, which are all impossible to predict. What we can do is to backtest how PALM would have done historically if it had been actively market making. We have backtested PALM with the amount mentioned above and compared it with holding. Value of Holding being if the DAO would just hold the 50% STG and 50% USDC over the same time period. As we can see, PALM outperforms holding while the price is going down, and is on par with the holding on the way up . A small note, this excludes all of the fees that the vault generates. ![image]([link]) For the services provided, Arrakis charges the following fees: Management fee: 1% AUM fee on a yearly basis Trading fee cut: 50% of trading fees the vault generates Reference For more information regarding Arrakis and Arrakis PALM, feel free to have a look at our docs and join our community. I'm also more than happy to respond to any comments here from the Stargate community about this proposal!

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary This proposal seeks Gnosis DAO to become a sponsor and partner that would partially fund terra0 to support the development of a novel large-scale art project in Germany that focuses on community-land stewardship managed by a DAO. The project will expand the use cases of the Gnosis ecosystem by using Gnosis infrastructure (Safe, Gnosis Chain, Zodiac) to manage and restore a forest over an indefinite time period. The artistic development is being supported by Light Art Space (LAS), a German art foundation focused on art, science, and technology and will culminate in a large-scale exhibition in Berlin (3-6 months), allowing for a broad, diverse, and non-native audience to be exposed to Gnosis and Web3. In parallel, terra0 will produce a legal framework allowing for the integration of a Gnosis Safe with the formation of a German Verein. As part of this proposal, terra0 will develop and provide tools to integrate Gnosis Safes with this framework and use the project to establish an inaugural precedent. terra0 seeks 195,000 from Gnosis DAO to help realize this ambitious project (~ 18.2% of 1,071,000 total project budget) The grant from Gnosis would help fund the purchase of a plot of land containing a forest in Germany and lay the groundwork for the legal framework and application of a DAO as a Verein for a Gnosis Safe. With this funding Gnosis DAO will: Sponsor the terra0 land art project and be featured on exhibition material, resulting in increased publicity, visibility, and user base for Gnosis, Gnosis Chain, and Gnosis Safe within a new cultural sphere. Support the development of a new legal framework for DAOs resulting in a composable template engine for Gnosis Safes which allows DAOs to be registered as a Verein in Germany, thereby creating new real-life applications for DAOs built on Gnosis tools. Receive an allocation of the tokens associated with the upcoming terra0 land art project and DAO. We also see Gnosis DAO as a key community member and participant in the project. Background terra0 is a group of developers, artists, and researchers who have been creating artworks and prototyping decentralized applications since 2016. Through technical experimentation, artistic exploration, and stress-testing legal frameworks related to natural resources, terra0 creates technological-augmented ecosystems and questions the contemporary representation of the living environment. In this final version of the project, realized for the first time on the scale of an entire forest in Germany, terra0 will develop a framework for the collaborative management of shared resources and explore alternative, non-exploitative valuations of nature. terra0 plans to instantiate a DAO to cooperatively organize the restoration of the ecosystem using bio-markers oriented towards greater biodiversity and resistance to environmental pressures. Previous terra0 works and prototypes can be seen on our website. They have been exhibited and discussed at the 58th Carnegie International, the 17th Architecture Biennial Venice, Canadian Centre for Architecture Montreal, The Shed New York City, Kunsthalle Z\u00fcrich, Francisco Carolinum Linz, Chronus Art Center Shanghai, Furtherfield Gallery London, Schinkel Pavillon Berlin, and Vienna Biennale, among others. Motivation Its no secret that we are in the midst of an ecological crisis spurred on, in large part, by excessive resource use and extraction. In the West, our relationship with the environment has been defined for centuries by lands productive value, which has led to gross ecological mismanagement and destabilization. terra0 seeks to re-orient this relationship towards intrinsic ecological value by applying Web3 principles of decentralized collective governance, communal ownership of public goods, and automated digital mediation in service of environmental resilience and autonomy. The development of decentralized programmable systems for exchanging value is giving rise to code and community-based digital organizational structures that enable democratic control of property. Novel ecological collectives such as those proposed by terra0 could distribute decision rights based on immanent bio-regional agency, relationships, and proximal metrics. Rationale As a collective, terra0 has been experimenting for years with Gnosis Safe as infrastructure for treasury management and as a trust anchor. Historically, we see Gnosis Chain and community as a place where DAO experiments happen; one we believe provides essential DAO infrastructure for the projects, affordable txs, and a community that cares deeply about its development. Gnosis' commitment to open standards whose design philosophy is one of expandability, inclusivity, and composability aligns with the terra0 ethos of experimenting with novel forms of governance and communities centered around ecological commons. The proposed art project is of value to the Gnosis community as it engages a diverse audience and is participatory in nature pairing ecological narratives with a concrete implementation of DAO governance. This includes visitors of the exhibition, online DAO members, local stakeholders, an international art audience, and experts from various fields. When combined with the timescale, exhibition, and participatory nature of the terra0 land art project, presents a unique opportunity to engage an audience that would not normally be accessible while increasing the capability and usage of the Gnosis ecosystem and Gnosis Chain. The land and forest will function as a permanent land art installation and be accompanied by an internationally recognized and large-scale public exhibition organized by LAS in Berlin over the period of 3-6 months which may travel to other locations in the future. This connection has the potential to enhance the public perception of Gnosis: applied ecology and community governance have rarely been publicly discussed and tested on such a scale. Additionally, the application and implementation of mapping a Verein onto a DAO will enhance how it can be perceived in a legal context one we hope will set a precedent that will allow for its legality to be recognized in other locals, contexts, and jurisdictions while featuring Gnosis Chain and tools as key components. Although the legal definition and context of a Verein is unique to Germany, once incorporated, it allows for international members to join the organization therefore not only being bound to the members residing in Germany (except seven core members) The possibility to integrate DAOs into a concrete legal structure using the Verein is an important building block for our project and enables real-world use cases in areas such as environmental protection and restoration. Implementation The land art project will be developed over the next year, in this process terra0 will purchase a plot of land containing a forest (10-20 hectares) in nearby proximity to Berlin, instantiate a DAO to augment the ecological agency of the ecosystem, and transfer the ownership of the land to it. The DAO governs the token systems, enforces the sovereignty of the underlying ecosystem, and mediates human oriented relations. The secondary function of the DAO is that of providing a social space, thus contributing to the stimulation of work groups and educational initiatives relating to ecology and technology. Many visitors and potential DAO participants will have little experience with blockchain and Web3 and will interact and be exposed to Gnosis Chain and ecosystem for the first time. Through a special statute and voting mechanism of the association which locks the ownership in the DAO, it also serves as a permanent protector of the piece of land against disposal and reintegration into economic dependence and exploitation. During the production period and exhibition terra0 and LAS will host a series of workshops and events to on-board and orient the community into the DAO. Gnosis DAO will receive a proportional amount of tokens relative to the proposed funding to participate in the terra0 land art project one that we see as a key member when engaging in a long-term project about the evolution of legal structures pertaining to DAOs and ecological management. The exhibition component of the terra0 land art project will be exhibited with LAS. Previous exhibitions produced by LAS can be viewed here 1. In recent exhibitions, LAS received approximately 25 000 30 000 visitors for the duration, an average of 600-800 visitors a day. Additional coverage of 60 100 media outlets enabled the exhibitions themes to be brought to the forefront of international discourse. For the land art project to be successful, the DAO requires a legal structure to hold and administer property (land) according to German law. We are currently working with legal teams to define a Gnosis Safe as the managing tool for a Verein under German jurisdiction. This framework will allow for the fluid recognition of token holders (as addresses) to be viewed as legal members of an organization at the time of voting without any additional registration. Two aspects are to be particularly emphasized: 1. The legal membership in the Verein will be defined only by a membership token, the associated address, and will not require the registration of identity through KYC (with the exception of seven registered members, which is a condition for each Verein in Germany) 2. Votes which take place with the help of the associated voting methods (such as Governor mod) to be legally defined by the association rules as \"continuous association meetings. If these two aspects are laid out in an association regulation, the Gnosis Safe can be legally integrated into a Verein without any additional infrastructure. The development period will be followed by an initial implementation and prototype of this legal structure that will be deployed as the framework for the DAO in conjunction with the land art project and exhibition. Following this, terra0 will create a web and Gnosis Safe app (this could take the form as something similar to KALI with increased functionality) with a DAO template engine that will allow and enable a DAO to be incorporated under German law as a Verein. The app will facilitate the deployment of a Gnosis Safe, create the legal documents required for the registration of the Verein under German law, and will use the Gnosis Safe and associated voting method.

The competition is viewed by many as a necessary evil that is being used to reduce the circulating supply of alchemica being that the economy does not have any meaningful and sustainable burning mechanisms currently in place. The preceding spending competition was a marked success especially based on the amount the DAO paid verses the amount of alchemica that was burnt. Its success however had the unforeseen consequence of increased alchemica issuance due to incentivizing the building and leveling of installations. Being that the latest spending competition is similar to the first and has not really addressed the unavoidable issuance increase of alchemica that concerns many DAO members, I am proposing a change to the cool down times of all reservoirs to help mitigate the expected increase and help extend the time period between the need for another spending event. THE PURPOSE The purpose of this proposal is : To help further manage the issuance of alchemica tokens by adjusting the ability to claim from up to 3 times a day to only 2 times per day To enact these changes early in the developmental stage as to prevent negatively affecting a vast amount of players later on To reduce players gas fees by increasing the period between claiming alchemica from reservoirs To enact safeguards to help mitigated increases to issuance caused from additional parcels becoming active, future land sales and/or other unforeseen events To help to extend the time-frame between spending events by maximizing the events positive effect on reducing the circulating supply of alchemica. THE DATA ([link] , [link]) & [link] In FUD we have 16,787 lvl 1 harvesters, at least 1,847 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 2,179 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 512 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 10,894 reservoirs. In FOMO we have 21,482 lvl harvesters, at least 1,732 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 2,698 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 894 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 12,356 reservoirs. In ALPHA we have 16,285 lvl harvesters, at least 1,533 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 1,629 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 480 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 9,347 reservoirs In KEK we have 11,328 lvl harvesters, at least 1,444 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 1,418 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 462 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 8,501 reservoirs This gives of the grand total of 41,098 reservoirs with 30,826 in the lvl 1- lvl 3 range which would be the cheapest to upgrade. (As of April 14 2023) This shows how fast the amount of circulating tokens has been increasing using FOMO as an example, however all alchemica have almost the same steep trajectory. ![image]([link]) Here is an example to show the effect a change could have using lvl 6 FOMO reservoirs. A lvl 6 reservoirs capacity is 80 fomo so if emptied every 8 hours thats 240 fomo daily and 1680 weekly. If we were to change it to a 12 hour schedule it would be reduced to 160 fomo daily and 1120 weekly. That would reduce issuance by 560 fomo weekly or 2240 fomo monthly. At first glance, it does not look to be a substantial reduction however when you apply it to the current total of 685 lvl 6 FOMO reservoirs the number transforms to a possible reduction to issuance of over 1.534 mil FOMO tokens monthly and that is just lvl 6 reservoirs. THE PLAN I am proposing that the cool down time increase from 8 hours to 11 hours. Players would benefit by having a natural 1 hour window to prevent time drift and this would easily facilitate an optimum 12 hour claiming schedule. POTENTIAL BENEFITS This change will allow parcel owners the flexibility to maintain a 12 hour emptying rotation set to their individual preference on their reservoirs by adding a 1 hour drift window which would help especially in high fee/high traffic time periods. The change would help to mediate increases in token issuance due to spending events by limiting daily issuance. This change will help to future proof increases to issuance caused by future parcels coming online, further leveling of reservoirs and future land sales which are still needed to complete the cathedral map by further gate keeping tokens entering the ecosystem. The change would come at a time-frame that will not negatively affect the vast majority of landholders due to an early implementation. POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE The biggest and probably the worse consequence from increasing the cool down time would be that we will have some owners sit with a full reservoir for 3 hours if they are on a 8 hour rotation of claiming their tokens presently. VOTING OPTIONS The voting options will be: Option 1: YES Change Reservoir Cool Down Times Option 2: NO Do Not Change Cool Down Times\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about changing the cool down times of all reservoirs to help manage the issues of alchemica token issuance.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nThis is a vote for how to restore agEURs peg. Context After Eulers repayment, a process to swap the received ETH [was voted]([link]) 7,408.83 ETH were swapped to a total of 15,541,130 USDC, and half of these USDC will be shortly swapped to EUROC. The current state of the protocol can be consulted [here]([link]) Now that the funds back agEUR are mostly USDC and EUROC, one way to restore the peg is to allow agEUR to be traded against the Core Module reserves. As the protocol should be expected to be reworked, keep in mind that this should be a transitory solution that is expected to last a few weeks. Also, the accepted collaterals wouldn't change, and the HAs functionality (Perpetual Futures hedging the protocol exposure) would stay paused, accordingly to what was voted [here]([link]) Proposal With this context in mind, there are several possibilities: 1. Unpause only the burn of agEUR, allowing people to sell agEUR to the protocol at 1. 2. Unpause mint & burn of agEUR, allowing people to buy and sell agEUR to the protocol at 1. 3. As proposed in [this governance proposal (option 1)]([link]), a third option can be to provide the protocol EUROC liquidity to the Curve agEUR-EUROC pool, allowing agEUR to get back to its 1 peg. 4. Do a mix of the options 1 and 3: allow agEUR redemptions for USDC through the Core Module, but also stabilize agEUR-EUROC using protocol reserves while we transition to V2. All options would allow arbitrageurs to buy agEUR on the market and sell it at 1 to the protocol. Note that the Core module comes with fees, and there would be fees applying for people burning (and minting if option 1 is chosen) through this mechanism. We propose to set the fees to the value they had on Friday 10th of March (before the USDC depeg), that is to say 0.5% when it comes to burn fees. Solution 1 has the advantage of only reducing the protocol exposure to USDC by allowing users to sell agEUR against the reserves, with the drawback of potentially reducing a lot the agEUR supply and Angle TVL. Solution 2 has the advantage of \"fully reopening the protocol and allowing people to mint agEUR with the Core module again, with the drawback of potentially increasing the protocol exposure to USDC. Solution 3s advantage is that it removes the need from having to reopen the protocol and taking potentially additional risks. Its drawback is that it is going to be less direct for people to burn they agEUR as they'll most likely end up with EUROC. In practice, when the agEUR / EUROC price is < 0.995, this voting solution will allow the Governor or Guardian multisig to use the protocol EUROC to either: - add EUROC to the pool if the total pool liquidity is < 5M, or - buyback agEUR with EUROC and burn agEUR when the total pool liquidity is > 5M On the other hand, it will also allow minting agEUR in the pool when the agEUR/EUROC price is > 1.005. Solution 4 combines both solutions 1 and solutions 3 for maintaining peg. It might be slightly less efficient than solution 1 alone when it comes to allowing the protocol to get rid of its USD/EUR exposure. Considerations It was voted on this vote as well to [unpause SLPs]([link]) Currently, as it stands (and as can be seen [here]([link])), there are: - 7,376,036.52 USDC on the PoolManager contract with claims of SLPs worth 5,269k USDC and claims of agEUR holders worth 15,620k USDC (as of the 14th of April) - 4,110,262.81 DAI on the PoolManager contract with claims of SLPs worth 1,372k DAI and claims of agEUR holders worth 1,658k DAI (as of the 14th of April) - 6,942,822.80 FRAX on the PoolManager contract with claims of SLPs worth 4,997k FRAX and claims of agEUR holders worth 1,888k FRAX (as of the 14th of April) Should option 1, 2 (and also 4) be chosen, the protocol would not have immediately all the USDC available to handle all redemptions. Given this, we suggest to swap the 3.4m DAI received from Euler to USDC. There would be a 2.6m USDC gap needed to handle everyone. In case more is redeemed, the protocol could use the obtained EUROC from the swap to sustain agEURs peg. Once again, all the four options are meant to be transitory options, to use at most till a Core module V2 is live and running. Voting Options 1. Unpause agEUR burn Unpause agEUR burn on the Core Module, allowing to sell agEUR to the protocol at 1. 2. Unpause mint & burn of agEUR Unpause agEUR mint and burn on the Core Module, allowing to buy and sell agEUR to the protocol at 1. 3. Maintain peg on Curve Provide EUROC liquidity to the Curve agEUR-EUROC pool, allowing to sell agEUR at 1 against EUROC on the pool. 4. Unpause burn + Curve peg Mix options 1 and 3 and maintain peg by unpausing agEUR burn on the Core Module and providing EUROC liquidity to the Curve agEUR-EUROC pool. Given the fact that keeping a depegged agEUR is harmful to the protocol, this vote is going to last for a limited timeframe.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This passage is proposing a vote on how to restore the peg of agEUR, the token associated with Angles Governance.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary This proposal establishes the Treasury Signer Selection Committee which will be responsible for vetting and appointing new Treasury Signers for the ShapeShift DAO. It also establishes the Treasury Signer role as a full-time paid role of the ShapeShift DAO with a formal job description, duties, standards of conduct, and compensation. Background The ShapeShift DAO has control of millions of dollars of funds that it uses to further its mission of building and maintaining the easiest-to-use decentralized interface for blockchains. To sustain the DAOs activity, including compensating the hundreds of active users who contribute to the DAO and to reimburse their expenses on behalf of the DAO, the DAO treasury must regularly create, sign, and broadcast blockchain transactions. Treasury Signers fulfill this function on behalf of the DAO. When the ShapeShift DAO was formed, ShapeShift AG appointed an initial set of Treasury Signers to manage its treasury, however, no process was established for what happens when a signer retires, or for appointing new signers to the set. Abstract The ShapeShift DAO needs to ensure there are sufficient Treasury Signers (TSes) to protect the ShapeShift DAO Treasury. This can be accomplished by delegating this responsibility to a new committee the Treasury Signer Selection Committee. This committee will appoint individuals who will fulfill the Treasury Signer role for the DAO. The Treasury Signer role will be compensated with 500,000 FOX tokens which shall be issued via a two-year Sablier stream established at the time of the TSs appointment. A formal Job Description of the Treasury Signer role is maintained on the ShapeShift DAO Notion site. Treasury Signer Selection Committee (TSSC) The TSSC is responsible for ensuring there are enough Treasury Signers appointed to manage the ShapeShift DAO Treasury. If there is not, the TSSC is responsible for researching and vetting candidates in private and appointing new TSes to ensure the business continuity of ShapeShift DAO treasury operations. To minimize the security impact to both the ShapeShift DAO and the Treasury Signers, the identities of Treasury Signers will not be disclosed to the DAO or to the public, and will only be disclosed to members of the TSSC. The TSSC shall be comprised of current workstream leaders of any ShapeShift DAO workstream, provided that the workstream leader has fulfilled their leadership duties for at least eight (8) months. While it is recommended that no fewer than two (2) and no more than five (5) Treasury Signers be appointed at any given time, the TSSC shall be granted full authority to appoint or dismiss TSes at their discretion to ensure the smooth operation and security of the ShapeShift Treasury. This will also include a previous Sablier stream for those who have been signers for the DAO for the previous 18 months to the tune of 750,000 FOX per signer for the time they have committed to doing so, so far. Benefits The benefits of formalizing this position and offering fair compensation include: Ensuring there is a process for the continuity of treasury operations for the ShapeShift DAO Ensuring the role is properly defined so that there is clarity on TS duties Ensuring the role is properly compensated so that candidates are incentivized to apply, and existing Treasury Signers have incentives to continue in their role. Ensuring there is a process for vetting candidates without divulging their identity to the public Drawbacks There is a cost to the DAO to fund these appointments The DAO does not have full visibility into the selection process, so they will have no choice but to trust the TSSC members to make good decisions on behalf of the DAO Vote A vote of Yes will establish the Treasury Signer Selection Committee as defined above, and formalize the Treasury Signer role as a full-time paid role of the ShapeShift DAO with 500,000 FOX compensation issued via a Sablier stream over two (2) years. A vote of No will do nothing.

The team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability. Introductory post + litepaper: [link] Long Term Value: Additionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption. A Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game Our game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore It features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference. Guild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution: [link] Token Sinks: The game will provide a sink for native tokens through \"Ranked Mode buy-ins in GHST and/or Alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables. Guild vs Guild: Along with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies Gotchichain: With the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience.

It also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition. As of today, I have achieved a verbal understanding with PC to have a limited licensing agreement extended to this project. Such a license will move into drafting and signatures only after the passage of this Sigprop. The agreement grants PC 20% of the revenue, and includes their support with smart contract development. (The remaining 80% is to be split evenly between player rewards and the DAO.) Its important to emphasize that this grant is specifically for the digital version of the game, although plans for an official PC physical version are already being discussed. From my talks with the PC team, they are very enthusiastic about the idea and already have multiple manufacturing and distribution leads for the tabletop physical.

Additionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to \"NO to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship. Some benefits of this proposal: Players will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games. Develops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility. There is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games. The specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change. Alchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets. The Graph of FUD emissions below shows the short and long-run effects of this proposal. Emissions reductions would be immediate and their impacts long-lasting if implemented. For example, after 1 year of implementation the emissions reductions is about -55% from the current trajectory & -20% reduction from a baseline of 0. ![image]([link]) Potential Risks: Players with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is Less engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity. Additional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers. This work was the result of several peoples efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards. Please weigh-in on your votes below!\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal seeks to change the kinship mechanics of Aavegotchis so that a set number of points are burned whenever someone channels their Gotchi.

Hello frens ! With the end of the curve, a substantial amount of funds has been given to the DAO. The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe its crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO. DAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. Thats why I am running for the position of treasurer. The purpose of the treasurer role would be to: Ensure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without missinterprertation possible. Ensure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc. Prepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all. Stay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury. Additionally, the role would also serve as an \"expert\" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO. As a current director, I receive a payment of 2,000 GHST every three months. Given the active nature of the treasurer role, I plan to dedicate two hours per day to this role and will be requesting an increase in compensation to 5,000 GHST per three months. Why choose me? I possess in-depth knowledge of DeFi and market making, enabling me to provide valuable advice on all financial decisions related to the DAO. I am well-versed in the DAOs structure and DAO fund locations. I think having a go-to person for all treasury matters can be helpful for the DAO.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nBackground Currently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a DEX, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades. Proposal Velodrome is the leading DEX on Optimism and the top Ethereum Layer 2 DEX with over $300M TVL. It serves as the the primary liquidity hub for the quickly growing Optimism ecosystem, serving 2x - 3x as many protocols of comparable DEXs. Velodrome works by directing VELO emissions to liquidity pools based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs. In the last voting round, bribers received $3.5 in VELO for every $1 in bribes on average. On top of the bribe multiplier, Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargates bribes per the \"Tour de OP\" incentive program, if Stargate moves $1.5M of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to Velodrome and bribes STG-USDC pool. Combined, the bribe multiplier and bribe match can yield a 4X+ impact on liquidity incentives for STG-USDC. The LP will still be used and routed through all aggregators, resulting in the same execution, but an APR higher than what Stargate is getting on the current Uniswap pools will be paid. If this pair performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to Optimism to add to Velodrome and receive additional VELO emissions. The Velodrome team will also work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users. Stargate will also lock farmed $VELO rewards as veVELO to significantly reduce the need for STG emissions in the future while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism. Additionally, locking veVELO will automatically qualify Stargate for a Lock Bonus, typically worth 30%-40% of the VELO locked, paid in OP. Execution $1.5m of POL will be moved from the Uniswap LP pool to Velodrome on Optimism. Simultaneously, Stargate will begin test run worth $500k in STG to bribe the STG-USDC pool at a rate of $100K per week. Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargates bribes each week. Once a voting epoch is completed on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, VELO emissions will flow to Stargates LP. If successful, this proposal will result in a higher APR to Stargates LP and a significant reduction of STG emissions over time. For the purposes of the pilot, Startgate will focus on locking all VELO farmed as veVELO to build a veVELO voting position and maximize the ROI provided by \"Tour de OP Incentives. This will also earn Stargate additional bribe boosts and lock bonuses which will be compounded into more $veVELO, creating an exponential effect to early $veVELO accumulation. As that position grows, it will direct additional emissions to STG pools, generate fee rewards and bribe revenue that can also be compounded into additional $veVELO. While the focus during the course of this pilot will be to maximally compound rewards, once the veNFT position reaches DAO targets, the DAO can begin to repurpose fees, bribes, and emissions for other purposes. The goal being to reach a state where the DAO can bribe and sustain liquidity without needing additional $STG emissions.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about Stargate moving $1.5 million worth of their protocols' owned liquidity from Uniswap to Velodrome, which is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Optimism.

Additionally, in order to maximize the return on investment for these rewards, Stargate will focus on locking all VELO farmed as vote-escrowed VELO (veVELO) Once targets are reached by this voting position, the DAO can repurpose funds and fees towards other purposes while still sustaining liquidity without needing more $STG emission."}]}

References/Useful links: > Link to: Website -> swellnetwork.io Documentation -> docs.swellnetwork.io Github Page -> [link] Discord -> [link] Twitter: [link] Protocol Description: > The Swell DAO was formed to build a liquid staking protocol to provide the holders of Ethereum (ETH) the means to earn yield through staking without the constraint of locking up capital. Swells mission is to create a more secure, decentralized and transparent financial future for the world that does not discriminate or censor economic freedom. The beginning of that journey for Swell starts with continuing to advance liquid staking as one of the fundamental building blocks of modern day decentralized finance (DeFi) that is composable and fully integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem. Similar to other LST protocols, Swell issues a liquid receipt token (swETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissioned validator set. The exchange rate between swETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though swETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Ethereum Shappella upgrade that will allow stakers to withdraw from the beacon chain. Motivation: > Swell is currently is looking to host a swETH-ETH pool on Balancer, that serves as the main source of liquidity for swETH. Swell is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its LST, starting with swETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Ethereum Shapella upgrade, liquidity and yield on LSTs will be a key competing factor as LST protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders. Swell is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual. Specifications: 1. Governance: Governance will be carried out on the Swell DAO Forum. [link] 2. Oracles: - Direct Balance Query: The swETH token has an internal getRate function (rate provider) that calls swETHs own wETHToETHRate function. See the contract here [Contract Link]([link]) For this reason the token address can be specified as the rate provider. - Chainlink PoR 3. Audits: [link] 4. Centralization vectors: Based on current design, repricing and deposits are done through a centralised bot run by the foundation. Repricing requires off-chain information to be published to the contract. It is not possible to allow others access to this at this time as they could publish incorrect information leading to incorrect repricing rates which could have the primary effect of allowing an attacker to mint an excess of swETH. The foundation has a path to getting all data needed fully on-chain/decentralised through Chainlink, however this will take some time. 5. Market History: swETH has just launched so there is not much market history and balancer will be the first pool supporting swETH 6.

This is to allow time for the next Aura voting cycle to complete to ensure any protocols providing voting incentives get the full value of those incentives. For those new gauges which get veBAL votes before May 4th the first emissions through the new gauges would start on May 11th.

Balancer grants DAO has been extremely supportive of our endeavor and we're excited to launch next month. You can learn more about the project here: [link] Motivation TWAMMs and Balancer pools in general are complicated to interact with in absence of a UX. We are building a dedicated relayer that abstracts the complexity from the end-user and provides safety in terms of slippage protection and error handling. We want to do this all from a smart contract thus maintaining the advantages of a fully on-chain protocol: permissionless, composability, & decentralization. Additionally, we don't want our protocol to be restricted by hostile regulatory regimes that target Web UX. Interactions Below are the two ways to interact with the core TWAMM contracts today via Gnosis Safe or Etherscan. Without a dedicated UX, the user would have to know how to set slippage, handle errors, etc themselves. Unsafe + complex: interact through Vault A user would have to create 'tuples' and be knowledgeable of Balancers Vault infrastructure. Furthermore, they would have to 'abi.encode' data specific to TWAMM like intervals, swap type, etc. ![[image]]([link]) Safe + intuitive: relayer/periphery contract Here the user would specify very simple inputs (similar to in a UX) in order to execute a long-term swap. ![[image]]([link]) Development We will create our Relayer, similar to Balancer Relayer ([[link]]([link])), but with added abstractions for the following functions: - 'function longTermSwap' - 'function shortTermSwap' - 'function partnerSwap' - 'function join' - 'function exit' - 'function withdraw' - 'function cancel' ![[image]]([link]) Security - The core contracts have been fully audited by SpearbitDAO: [[link]]([link]) - The periphery contract will be audited by SpearbitDAO as well. - Users of this relay will have to explicitly approve the relayer before using it. - Relayer actions will be scoped to: 'join, exit, swap' - We will scope the relay to only interact with TWAMM pools recognized by our Factory contract: ![[image]]([link]) Tradeoffs Balancer Attack vectors: addressed in the security section Ease of use for a new pool type Expand Balancer pool interaction to fully on-chain Exploring & developing the Relayer ecosystem for other teams, integrators Cron Increase of attack surface Vastly improved on-chain UX Moat against copycats, vampire forks Simplified onboarding of different user personas: whales, protocols, 3rd party front-ends Users, integrators Additional gas costs of the periphery Interact directly without UX/3rd party Ease of use and integration Safety and slippage checks are done by the periphery Abstract TWAMM complexity Governance We would like governance to approve this relayer so we can onboard users faster, improve user experience, and reduce the complexity to interact with TWAMMs. Relayer Information: [link] Balancers architecture requires governance approval for 'CronFi: Relayer' for these actions: Vault Actions: - '\"joinPool(bytes32,address,address,(address,uint256,bytes,bool))\": \"[hexadecimals]' - '\"exitPool(bytes32,address,address,(address,uint256,bytes,bool))\": \"[hexadecimals]\"' - '\"swap((bytes32,uint8,address,address,uint256,bytes),(address,bool,address,bool),uint256,uint256)\": \"[hexadecimals]' Documentation: [link]\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This passage is discussing a proposal for the development of a relayer to be used with TWAMMs and Balancer pools in order to create a more user-friendly on-chain experience.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nPR with Payload [link] Service Provider Name: Beethoven X DAO Core Contributor(s): franz, vee, jedi rasta, naly, josey, jeff, groninge, tom, daniel Pledge to abide by the DAOs [Code of Conduct]([link]) (or link to your own): Yes Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines]([link]): Yes Introduction & Domains of Operation: Since becoming a [Friendly Fork]([link]), Beethoven X and Balancer have developed a strong working relationship, marked by the successful launch of a [joint venture on Optimism]([link]) Throughout this collaboration, it has become clear that there is a significant amount of overlap in the work being done on both sides, and there is an opportunity to streamline efforts. Recognizing this, both Balancer and Beethoven X have continually expressed a desire to work closer together. In an effort to accelerate the collaboration, Balancer Labs engaged Beethoven X contributors in a 3-month trial contract beginning on February 1, 2023. This collaboration has allowed both teams to leverage each others strengths and work together to drive technical innovation for the Balancer DAO. As Balancer pursues its path towards further decentralization, we believe the inclusion of the Beethoven X DAO in its pool of service providers would represent a significant step in furthering this goal. In this proposal, we will provide an update on the progress of the collaboration and present our plans for the future. We believe that by working collaboratively, we can achieve greater efficiency and drive innovation for the benefit of the entire Balancer ecosystem. Balancer API Beethoven X launched a custom UI in August 2022, with the goal of providing a fast and smooth user experience. To facilitate this goal, a significant amount of energy and resources were invested into the development of a custom backend API. [[link]]([link]) While OpCo has also been in the process of developing their own API, it was recognized that the Beethoven X API is in a more mature state and both sides would benefit from collectively supporting and building on a single API moving forward. Over the last two months, members from OpCo, Balancer Labs and Beethoven X have worked collaboratively to deploy a joint API infrastructure that will service both Balancer and Beethoven X moving forward: [[link]]([link]) OpCo has started the process of integrating the API into the Balancer UI, which should serve to provide a smoother UX in many ways. The success of this project speaks to the collaborative nature of all teams involved. Scaffold-balancer As part of the roadmap planning for Q1 of 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a suite of tools that could make it significantly easier to start developing a custom pool contract on top of the Balancer protocol. [[link]]([link]) Scaffold-balancer is a fork of the well known scaffold-eth project geared specifically around facilitating the rapid prototyping of new Balancer pool types. We strongly believe that if we make it simple to get started and succeed early, it will provide developers the motivation and inspiration to slowly peel back the layers of complexity that is the Balancer protocol and develop something truly innovative. Current feature set: Generic Pool UI - Allows you to interact with any existing or locally deployed pool contracts, making the time-to-test significantly shorter. The UI focuses on single contract actions (swap/join/exit) for both query and tx submission. SOR Playground - Provides granular config on the pools, tokens, types, etc that are included into the routing. The idea being that you can provide tight constraints around the dataset to see how your custom pool performs when benchmarked against existing liquidity, although it could also quite easily be used to benchmark the performance of the SOR generally. Batchswap builder - A UI for building arbitrarily complex batch swaps. Beyond the initially developed feature set, Jo\u00e3o from Orb integrations has also started to build out [managed pool controller examples inside scaffold-balancer]([link]) While still in its infancy, we believe this tool already provides significant value to developers looking to start the journey of developing their own custom pool on Balancer. SDK / SOR The existing SOR was built before the widespread adoption of BigInt math and the advent of boosted pools. As the number of deployed pools has continued to grow, the existing SOR has come up against performance limitations. Mike McDonald recently initiated a project to rewrite the SOR with a focus on speed and performance. We've supported Mike in this process, including implementing a novel graph traversal algorithm for path finding that is boosted pool native. [[link]]([link]) The implementation of a robust API has presented an opportunity to rethink the role that the Balancer SDK should fill. This repo will become the home of the new Balancer SDK. Technical Advisor While I (daniel) am a builder at heart, I've worked in senior developer and CTO roles for the better part of 10 years, and have worked professionally as a software developer for 15 years. The Balancer Labs leadership has been incredibly open and allowed me to begin to play a larger role across the entire ecosystem. Over the last several months, I've started attending regular ecosystem meetings, engaged in conversations on product development, participated in partnership discussions, and taken a role in helping to collaboratively define the future of the Balancer SDK. Marketing, content and design Over the past 18 months the Beethoven X marketing team have established a brand that has come to be recognised for not only its unique personality but its approach to community building and content creation. Our goal has been to build a competent community of engaged users that are as passionate about our ecosystem as we are. The focus for our marketing efforts has been centered around producing high quality educational material on the underlying technology as well as cultivating an ethos of care and compassion for our community. Combining a strong visual aesthetic with an approachable brand identity has allowed our content, voice and style to flourish and has cemented our place as one of the top DeFi protocols on Fantom and Optimism. Weekly newsletters, threads, docs, NFTs, giveaways, community competitions, animations, long form articles, ambassador programs, live events, and financial reporting has enabled community members to keep up to date with the Beethoven X ecosystem. Building from a foundation of innovation that intertwines within current trends, social narratives and symbiosis offers the opportunity to establish a flourishing community base that is educated and empowered to engage in the ecosystem. While not part of the original agreement, we set forth to showcase this competency. For the past 3 months the marketing team has started to work on the following initiatives. Landing Page As part of the roadmap planning for Q1 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a landing page that clearly, concisely and with strong visuals, answers the question that is at the center of the growth of Balancer as a platform. \"Why should I build on Balancer? To date, 10 in-depth interviews have been performed with developers and key contributors across the Balancer ecosystem, and work has begun on developing a cohesive storyline. The landing page will intertwine strong visual design with technical information to create an engaging experience that highlights what sets Balancer apart. Social Media & Design Beethoven X contributors have started developing a framework for the evolution of the Balancer social media presence. The goal is to create a strong visual identity that not only showcases the technical capabilities of Balancer but also embodies a compelling personality that leverages current trends and social narratives, similar to what we strive for with the Beethoven X brand. Content Creation Beethoven X contributors have started producing in depth twitter threads on relevant topics in the Balancer ecosystem: [[link] ]([link])[link] and kickstarted a technical article series: [[link]]([link]) Key Objectives & Success Metrics: Make it easier to build on Balancer - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack. Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today? Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol? Our strategy for Balancer marketing would be to highlight the major benefits of Balancer protocol across its user demographics in an engaging, informative manner. The focus of this strategy would be to educate users on product innovation, current trends and partnership developments. Coupled with engaging design / visuals the strategy stands to bring Balancer back into the limelight on social media and hopefully ignite a flywheel for growth based on relevancy, product and community. Balancer has never been more successful than it is today and we would strive to complement its immense success. In this regard there are 2 key focuses: - Brand Development - Encapture the core brand values and inspire. Although a reputable figure, there is room to create an inspirational brand aesthetic that speaks well to current trends in a timeless, tasteful fashion. - Social Presence - Building from a foundation of insightful content and leveraging an unique aesthetic, social presence represents Balancers voice. As a thought leader in the industry the goal for the Balancer voice is to showcase competency and relevancy through social media outlets in a playful, engaging manner. Length of Engagement & Budget: Beethoven X is requesting 3 months of funding starting May 1, 2023 and ending July 31, 2023. We request to continue the budget of $25,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month for technical development and advisory. Additionally, we strongly believe that Beethoven X contributors can provide significant value in the areas of marketing, content creation and design. For this effort, we propose an additional budget of $15,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month. As these funds will be used to cover a portion of contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $40,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.

Context On the day after the Euler hack, in order not to lure people into a stablecoin that was about to depeg, [the governance multisig set]([link]) the ANGLE inflation rate to 0, meaning no new ANGLE tokens have been issued since the Thursday 16th of March that followed. As the protocol got refunded by Euler, and as it is about to restart (if it has not by the time this is voted), it makes sense to relaunch ANGLE incentives for the protocol. These have globally useful for the protocol to gain in traction and acquire some integrations. Growing a stablecoin like agEUR is basically a matter of finding solutions to the chicken and egg issue: no one will use the stablecoin unless other people use it. ANGLE incentives are a mechanism that can help overcome some of these issues, and help get network effects around agEUR. This is not an end, and more a means to an end. Here, as the protocol has taken a reputational hit with the hack, launching incentives is not only going to be a way to attract new people, it'll also reward remaining stakeholders of the protocol. Proposal Proposal here is to re-launch ANGLE incentives but with less gauges than before the Euler hack. We suggest to only keep the following gauges: - Uniswap V3 agEUR-USDC 0.01% - Uniswap V3 agEUR-ETH 0.05% - Curve Incentives - Sushiswap agEUR-ANGLE - Polygon agEUR-USDC 0.01% This implies killing the following gauges: - sanUSDC - sanDAI - sanFRAX - Curve agEUR-ibEUR - Curve 3EUR (this one was directly sending rewards to the Curve pool) There have been discussions on how to best take advantage of the learnings of the situation to build a better protocol. In this governance post, we shared our vision for a V2 of the Core module of the protocol, in a system that does not involve SLPs. To this extent, while the Standard Liquidity Providers strategies can easily be re-launched within a short time frame and hence SLPs be rewarded for their liquidity, these are less central in the vision we are supporting for the protocol, around agEUR and stablecoins more generally. When it comes to the inflation rate, suggestion is to put the rate to what it would have been if incentives had not moved. This can be found [in this document]([link]), and this makes a rate of 2.141752792 ANGLE tokens issued by second. Implementation This proposal can be easily implemented by calling the 'toggleGauge' function in the 'AngleDistributor' contract. The function setRate' also offers rate adjustments. Its important to note that its possible to keep votes on gauges that have been killed, but that this results in a lowered ANGLE inflation. For instance if 10% of the veANGLE voting power is on SLP gauges and these votes are not removed (they can be removed at any time), then total ANGLE inflation will not be 2.141752792 tokens per second, but 90% of it. Happy to hear any feedback on this! This seems like an important proposal to have executed, probably not before this Thursday but probably before the one after. Voting Options 1. For, relaunch & kill gauges 2. Against, amend proposal\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is suggesting that ANGLE incentives should be restarted following the same inflation rate that was set during the Euler hack.

The Yield Bonding mechanism allows users to deposit yield-earning assets and receive COIL instead of their underlying rewards, which are then deposited into yield-earning strategies in our treasury. COIL absorbs the sell pressure that BAL/AURA would typically face, as 100% of the yields earned are locked in non-predatory strategies managed by the Spiral DAO team. Motivation: Spiral DAO is a governance-maxi DAO dedicated to building around ve-tokenomics, and Balancer in particular, aggregating and maximising governance power and exposure towards the Balancer ecosystem. It is important for us to be able to participate in emissions Balancer. As much as Balancer is one of our main liquidity sources for the DAO liquidity with the highest volume market as well. The inclusion of Spiral DAOs COIL token in the Balancer gauge would benefit both Spiral DAO and the broader Balancer community. As all the BAL/AURA tokens that get into Treasury are utilised, and as the yields are not sold, it can create a beneficial positive loop for the ecosystem. Besides that, Spiral DAO is looking to become a stable and long-term bribes buyer to sustain and increase its liquidity and exposure towards BAL ecosystem. We believe that may be beneficial for all veBAL voters. We ask for a 10% emission cap for our gauge, as Spiral DAO currently owns about 115k BAL, or about 800k USD at current prices, see [Treasury Multisig]([link]) And looking to greatly increase its liquidity.

References/Useful links: Website - [[link]]([link]) Documentation - [[link]]([link]) Github Page - [[link]]([link]) Communities - [unshETH]([link]) Other useful links? Twitter - [[link]]([link]) Blog - [unshETH]([link]) Protocol Description: unshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices. Within Ethereums DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETHs mission is simple decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network. unshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship. LSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer. Motivation: unshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the second step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pools BPT is intended to be unshETHs ve-locking token for governance participation and a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains. Details: Governance: unshETHs governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023 Oracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time. Omnichain: The USH and unshETH tokens are omnifungible (OFT-20) tokens. Audits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [[link]]([link]) Centralization vectors: The unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the projects dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance. With the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters. The deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH teams ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023. The launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights. Market History: The USH and unshETH tokens were launched on 1/31/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VCs or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog ([unshETH Express: $USH and vd(3,3,3) unshETH]([link])) to: Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers) Team and early contributors The airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign. Value: $USH trading metrics as of 04/18/2023 (Sushiswap: [[link]]([link])): Specifications: Gauge Weight Cap unshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10% The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes. unshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57. Gauge Type Note that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers. Core Pools Designation: While this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nProposal: Allocate 1m GEAR ($14k at current prices) per 2-week epoch to bribe vlAura holders (via HiddenHand) to vote for the [Balancer Boosted Gearbox USD Pool]([link]) for the purpose of evaluating efficiency relative to directly rewarding GEAR to lenders on Gearbox, and to simultaneously raise awareness for Gearbox and the lending pools to the Aura and Balancer communities. If desired by multisig, multisig to coordinate with Aura on sending multiple installments to reduce burden (ie, send 1 month of GEAR and Aura will custody the GEAR and bribe the appropriate amount each epoch) Alternatively, the multisig can conduct bi-weekly operations directly via HiddenHand. Justifcation (Less Technical) Balancers boosted pool system allows a portion of a liquidity pool to be deployed in yield bearing strategies, without sacrificing depth of the liquidity pool. This allows LPers to earn additional yield on their position while still allowing large swaps through the pool. An initial pool has been created for USDC, DAI, dUSDC, and dDAI. This means traders can swap USDC and DAI in the pool, while LPers earn yield from lending USDC and DAI to Gearbox on a portion of their liquidity position. The pool earns yield in the form of swap fees, base yield (USDC, DAI), external rewards (GEAR), and internal rewards (AURA, BAL) A portion of the yield is passed on to the LPer, a portion goes to the DAO treasury/veBAL, and another portion is used to bribe voters to vote for the pool (essentially this means LPers get a little extra yield, but in the form of AURA/BAL instead of GEAR) An initial group of vlAura holders voted for the Gearbox USD pool. This created initial rewards in BAL/AURA, which brought TVL, which brings APR that goes to LPers/bribes, etc. There is a potential flywheel here, where an 'altruistic' baseline of voters will create baseline incentives, which brings TVL, which brings APR, which brings more TVL, etc, etc. A key piece of this flywheel is the [Aura bribe multiplier]([link]) which is historically between 1 and 1.5 ($1 paid to aura voters will send between $1.5 and $2 of emissions to the pool) However, the initial vote has ended - so a new altruistic voter would need to step in to continue to grow the pool. Or, perhaps a voter that is already spending GEAR for diesel pools - aka, Gearbox. The primary question here is: If we spend GEAR to bribe vlAura voters to vote for this pool, do we actually get more dUSDC and dDAI liquidity than if we send GEAR to the lenders directly? The answer is: MAYBE. Essentially there are a LOT of assumptions and variables, but in general most conditions lead to it being somewhere between slightly worse and a bit better (see below section for more information) So - the goal of this proposal is to fill in the void in voting, in order to see if the pool grows as we expect it to over time. The purpose would be to re-evaluate in the future to determine if a more significant portion of lending pool liquidity mining would make sense to divert to this pool. Additionally, the presence of a stablecoin pool with reasonable yield can bring new eyes to Gearbox and the lending pools from the Aura/Bal communities (which should encapsulate a decent chunk of active DeFi yield farmers/lenders) More Technical Context A boosted pool begins with a [linear pool]([link]) This is a pool that pairs a yield bearing asset with its underlying collateral. For example, yvWETH and WETH. The pool has a target weighting that can be compared to the actual pool balance onchain with expected price functions of the yield bearing asset. When a pool user helps restore the pool balance closer to the target, they receive a credit. When they push it further off balance, they pay a fee. The bigger a pool, the higher % of yield bearing asset it can hold as the target balance is a flat number (not a percentage) The linear pool token can then be paired with another asset to create a boosted pool. For example, a yvWETH/WETH linear pool could be paired with GEAR to create a GEAR/(yvWETH/WETH) market where a specified percentage of WETH (based on the linear pool balance) is deployed in Yearn. We would be looking at creating and utilizing base pairings with Gearboxs diesel lending pools (dWETH, dUSDC, etc) This [spreadsheet]([link]) has been created to model two potential use cases: 1. Comparing sending GEAR rewards to the gearbox DAI and USDC lending pools with instead bribing the Gearbox boosted pool 2. Comparing liquidity mining GEAR/WETH on Curve v2 with a potential GEAR/(wETH/dWETH) pool on balancer The spreadsheet takes inputs from the current GEARBOX pools and compares them to bribing vlAura voters. There are a few highly impactful variables here such as the vote multiplier, the assumed APR that LPers will demand (because the protocol does not set the APR - the LPers decide that, the protocol just dictates total rewards), and pool size. The purpose is to determine which approach represents a net savings in spendings on both liquidity mining programs. These variables are highly. .well. variable. and therefore it is difficult to draw a meaningful conclusion. The spreadsheet also details and incorporates the exact breakdown of fee share in boosted pools. Note the GEAR/WETH comparison does not yet include the option to bribe the curve pool. However, because the altruistic anon votes for the curve pool seem to have dried up, this scenario should also be considered if considering changes to GEAR/WETH liquidity mining. A note on bribes It would be fair to ask \"this bribe multiplier thing seems too good to be true, who tf loses in this case? Ultimately I think bribes/liquidity mining/etc are all a manifestation of P/E ratios. You can give $1 of profit to an LPer every year, or you can give that same LPer a token that entitles them to $1 of profit this year, and a bit less every year after that assuming the protocol doesn't grow and they keep getting diluted by giving out new tokens. In the investing world, most investments are valued at some Price/Earnings ratio greater than 1. That means the token promising ~$1/year is almost always valued by the market as worth more than $1. As long as that is true, it will always be better to distribute tokens instead of direct revenue to incentivize protocol use. Granted, the game is different in DeFi as many tokens do not distribute revenue and instead only offer governance - but despite that, many tokens still trade at a P/E ratio far greater than 1 (if not a negative number because earnings are negative) TL;DR as long as the investing world is pricing in growth, bribes gud for bootstrapping/sourcing liquidity where imbalanced.

ETH is Lido DAOs primary Unit of Account, interchangeable with stETH through deposits and withdrawals using Lido protocol. 2. Lido DAOs treasury is the source of its resilience and future growth, and can fund initiatives that further the protocols decentralization and network security objectives 1. The purpose of Lido DAOs treasury is to support the integrity, growth and robustness of the Lido protocols 2. The treasury may also be used for funding many initiatives, including but not limited to, research, maintenance, development, education and advocacy that further the decentralization and network security objectives of the protocol 3. Risk of loss to treasury funds should be minimized at every instance 4. All treasury ETH must be staked using Lido 5. Token holders have the ultimate say 1. Token holder decisions can amend and update the Principles, as well as override the Committee through separate on-chain votes (nb. 20,304 ETH at time of writing) Treasury Management Committee 1. A Committee should be formed to maintain and execute policies 1. Token holders authorize the formation of a Treasury Management Committee composed of members (alt. signers) around a multisig that will be allowed to submit a narrow set of possible Strategies and activate their corresponding on-chain Actions, constrained through On-chain tools 2. The Committee multisig will strictly never take custody of Aragon funds and will use a suitable technical solution for executing swaps in a permissionless way 3. This 4/7 multisig will be composed of 7 individual members or entities and will not be authorized to function with fewer than 7 members 4. A new signer who doesn't otherwise participate in the Token Rewards Program will be eligible to participate. This will enhance governance decentralization of Lido DAO by adding new members over time consistent with the loyalty to the project. These signers would be eligible to receive the equivalent of 25 ETH a year in LDO tokens, priced on the day the signer joins the multisig for the first time (subject to usual TRP rules including milestones, for example current version of TRP LDO exchange rate calculation is \"calculated as the trailing 180-day close price of LDO, using the following [Dune query]([link])) 5. If any signer fails to register their approval or rejection on at least 50% of the Actions proposed in a given year, their TRP program membership (if any) will forfeit and the signer will be rotated from the multisig and removed from the Committee 6. Members will retain membership of the Committee until they offboard either of their own accord or by token holder demand, forfeiting any pending TRP tokens, and leaving the multisig seat open for new prospective members to be approved by token holders 7. Deliberations, Strategies, and Actions will be communicated transparently to the DAO and the community is encouraged to engage, propose and participate 8. New prospective members can apply in public forums to empty Committee seats and request approval of their inclusion into the Committee by token holders, an approval which will instruct the Committee to rotate the new member/s onto the empty place/s on the multisig 2. Committee may submit Strategies and enact Actions 1. All Strategies must be encodable into Actions through On-chain tools 2. All deployed on-chain Actions will allow for at least 72h of token holder veto periods prior to deployment or execution 3. The Committee will submit these Strategies in the following way: 1. The committee will publish a forum post submitting the Strategy (e.g. sell stETH in Aragon for one of a pre approved list of tokens) 2. No sooner than 7 days from the moment it is published, the treasury multisig can initiate the start of an on-chain Action or series of Actions 4. The Committee will regularly provide transparency reports 3. Committee may propose modifications to authorized Strategies 1. The Committee may elect to propose changes or new Strategies, provided they are encodable into Actions through On-chain tools 1. To enact a new rule or change, the Committee will publish a forum post outlining the change to request comments and allow for a feasibility study 2. No sooner than 7 days from the moment it is published, if suitable as an on-chain Action, token holders will vote on the approval of the deployment of an on-chain Action to reflect the new Strategy, or change in Strategy 2. The Committee will maintain an up-to-date frontend listing the Principles, all of the Strategies they are authorized to submit and links to the relevant on-chain Treasury Actions for these rules 3. The Committee will only be able to propose changes or new rules provided 4/7 members register their agreement with the proposal 4. Community members may propose a new Strategy to the Committee for consideration, but the Committee will need 3/5 members to register their agreement prior to submitting these changes 4. Committee mandate is bounded by token holder approval 1. Token holders may choose to dissolve the Committee at any time through a vote, following which the Committee will disband, terminate the TRP if necessary and remove its access from any on-chain motions 2. Should an overall governance framework be agreed on by token holders at a later date, this could lead to the ratification, modification or dissolution of the Committee 5. Committees ultimate objective is to automate itself 1. The Committee is charged, in the long-term, with identifying and implementing ways of automating its deliberations and replacing the function of the Committee with permissionless smart contracts with no dependencies, capable of replacing the above workflow in a neutral manner On-chain tools These are on-chain contracts or function calls, such as EasyTrack motions or Aragon votes, that can execute any Actions triggered by the Committee multisig. Token holders authorize the Committee to request the development of new Actions to the Lido Contributors Group. Alternatively, token holders authorize the Committee to propose development projects to the Lido Contributors Group, with separate funding requirements, if needed. Any new development must undergo strict security procedures and audits prior to being used in production. Treasury Management Strategies An example of the Strategies that could be submitted by the Committee are the following: - Hold no more than 6mos of estimated working capital to fund research, development, education and advocacy initiatives (based on approved budgets) in stablecoins in Aragon - Hold only DAI, LUSD and USDT in stablecoin reserves (60% USDT, 40% DAI) - Only use CoW Swap as a preapproved trading venue Treasury Management Actions An example of the Actions that could be executed by the Committee are the following: - Stake any ETH held in the Aragon treasury using Lido - Sell stETH or any other tokens in Aragon for one of a list of preapproved stables through a preapproved trading venue The example flow for enacting a Action to sell stETH for stablecoins could look like the below: ![image(2)png]([link]) The example optimistic governance flow from Strategy proposal to Action enactment: ![image(3)png]([link]) Initial Treasury Management Committee composition The below slate of prospective Treasury Management Committee members helped, among others, in producing this proposal and is proposed concurrently with this vote.

Context On the day of the Euler hack, the guardian multisig set all debt ceilings on the Borrowing module across all the chains where it is deployed to 0. Rationale for this was to prevent people from further shorting agEUR, and reducing the potential surface of exploit for the protocol. On top of that, before the hack, the protocol invested its surplus in pair with some minted agEUR in liquidity pools on Optimism and Arbitrum. [This vote]([link]) had for instance led the protocol to seed pools on Arbitrum and Optimism with minted agEUR paired with USDC from the surplus. To limite potential losses for the protocol and the DAO, this liquidity had been pulled on the day of the Euler hack. Now that funds have been fully recovered in the hack (with an excess), and that the protocol has an around $7m surplus, the protocol is again in position to seed pools with USDC. Having liquidity on chains where the Borrowing module is deployed is essential as it is a guarantee that liquidations can be done efficiently, with no strong concern of accruing bad debt when a position is badly collateralized. While on Polygon and Ethereum the protocol does have liquidity through incentives, there is no such thing on Arbitrum and Optimism, and it therefore makes sense to seed pools there. Proposal Proposal is to increase the debt ceilings for all the collateral assets of the protocol to the levels they had before the Euler hack on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. The protocol controls through its Governor and Guardian multisig 224,636 USDC on Optimism, and 204,675 USDC on Arbitrum. Idea with the proposal is to add these USDC with minted agEUR on Uniswap V3 on both chains. The protocol already controls minted agEUR on Optimism and Arbitrum (the recovered agEUR were not burnt during the wind down process), so it'd just mint in case theres not enough in the liquidity positions. Implementation As the funds are already on the multisig, this vote can easily be implemented by the governor multisig for both the liquidity provision and the debt ceilings parts. Value to the protocol There are currently no ways to mint new agEUR in the market with the Core module being open just for mints. Reopening the Borrowing Module provides a safe way to bring more agEUR into the market. The state with the Core module open for burns and Borrowing module enabled is a reliable state for the protocol in which it could safely stay until a Core V2 is out. There would be little to no composability risk whatsoever and agEUR pegs could easily be sustained while providing ways for the stablecoin to keep scaling. Risks This proposal implies using a portion the surplus immediately available of the protocol (surplus already present on Arbitrum and Optimism) There is a risk of bad debt also possible with the agEUR paired with USDC in the liquidity, but given the size of the pool proposed and the surplus, this risk is acceptable as the surplus could easily absorb it at this point.

Context After Eulers repayment, a process to swap the received ETH[was voted]([link]) 7,408.83 ETH were swapped to a total of 15,541,130 USDC, and half of these USDC were swapped into EUROC. The details of the swaps that were performed can be found [here]([link]) Overall, the protocol ended with a profit of 1,605,625.63 USDC compared to the pre-Euler hack situation. While this could be used to mitigate the loss that the protocol made during the USDC depeg (approx. 640k USDC) and the changes in the USD / EUR while the protocol was paused (approx. 350k USDC), the protocol also used to distribute a portion of the profits from its yield strategies to its SLPs. Prior to the hack, the parameters for profits made by the USDC strategy were for instance the following: 30% for sanTokens (SLPs),50% for veANGLE,20% for the protocol surplus, ultimately benefiting agEUR collateralization. Note as well that before the hack, there was also a setup which allowed the protocol to apply a loss to all SLPs. In case the protocol was badly collateralized, SLPs could face a slippage when they exited. The protocols Core module looked into the global collateral ratio, meaning that if the funds from the hack had not been recovered, SLPs from all collateral assets would have likely made a loss. While this discussion on profits is pending, SLPs are still paused in the protocol. It was voted [here]([link]) to make sure that SLPs remain independent of agEUR and that no yield strategies are in place for the moment. The protocol could relaunch in the future new yield strategies, fully dissociated from the stablecoin, so SLPs can keep earning interest. Proposal The proposal is to distribute 30% of the 1,605,625.63 USDC profits made in the hack to SLPs, and to spread this distribution between SLPs of all collateral assets proportionally to the $ value of their sanTokens as of the 24th of April 2023. We suggest in the vote two different options for the distribution: - Option 1: distributing these 481,687.689 USDC to SLPs over a period of 30 days through the gauge contract corresponding to each collateral. In this option, the protocol could keep deposit paused, but keep withdrawals open. Logic for this option is that it would leave some time for the protocol to reopen new strategies for SLPs and prove that it can still provide valuable APRs to them. This solution would reward more accounts that are aligned with Angles long-term vision. - Option 2: distributing these profits immediately to SLPs by increasing the sanRate (exchange rate between sanToken/collateral) for each collateral asset of the protocol A future vote could decide if something can be done with this profit for veANGLE holders. Implementation The first option can be implemented by calling the 'deposit_reward_token' function and deposit USDC for each SLP. The second option can be easily implemented following the recent PoolManager upgrade by calling the 'accumulateInterestOrSignalLoss' function. Voting Options 1. Option 1, distribute over 30 days 2.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nAuthor: @jasper-rocketpool, @dybsy Summary: This is a proposal for HOP protocol to offer fast bridging support for rETH to/from Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum L1. The Rocket Pool Incentive Committee will be offering $RPL incentives to rETH/hrETH AMM LPs on Optimism and Arbitrum to facilitate the process. We propose a starting plan of 50 $RPL / 28 day period in incentives per L2 with the intent to scale the amount as we support additional chains based on volume building across ecosystems. One binding piece of the proposal would be if Hop Protocol were to consider matching Rocket Pool with $HOP co-incentives. We suggest 12k $HOP per 28 day period per L2. The Rocket Pool treasury is very small relative to most DAOs and partnerships are how we are able to compete. These incentives will go towards the $rETH Bonder, run by a prominent member of the Rocket Pool community. Rationale: The Rocket Pool protocol produces the $rETH liquid staking token, third-largest by MCAP. The network is composed of over 2,000 node operators spread all throughout the world. This wide blanket of security means the $rETH token is incredibly decentralized and robust. The protocol is entirely permissionless to run validators on and is very aligned with the ethos of Ethereum broadly. The protocol has undergone auditing with all the top firms - Consensys Diligence, Sigma Prime, Trail of Bits, and also has a $250k Immunefi bug bounty. The token follows a cToken model, meaning the rewards passively accrue as the rETH/ETH ratio climbs. This is ideal for layer 2 adoption as the token is very simple relative to rebasing tokens. The rETH token is already available on Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, ZkSync, and Ethereum mainnet. There is an ongoing liquidity program on Optimism that has driven 3.4k rETH to that network. A further 1.5k rETH exists naturally on Arbitrum. These networks all have rETH on them, however, it is a large challenge for the market to keep the token value balanced across all said networks. The native 1-week timelock makes this arbitrage difficult. We anticipate this arbitrage flow to expand as new liquidity programs begin on different chains. Fast bridging support for rETH on Hop would be a major UX improvement for Rocket Pool users and it would also drive volume + usage for Hop Protocol. There is no other bridge that supports rETH. This would make Hop a major destination for all liquid staking token arbitrage. As the Atlas upgrade rolls out, the $rETH supply is expected to undergo massive growth from collateral reduction from 16 8 ETH and solo staker migration. Further, as far as our research has shown (Celer, Synapse, HOP), if HOP onboarded rETH, it would be the first cross-chain bridge for any liquid staking token, potentially ushering in a brand new market that is only bound to grow. Early movers often end up taking a lions share of volume, and so it is in HOPs best interest to move fast to entrench the advantage. Considering the above, we think it would make sense for Hop protocol to co-incentivize hToken liquidity with Rocket Pool on Optimism and Arbitrum. Specification: Seed bonders on L1 with rETH from the Rocket Pool Community Incentivize liquidity for hrETH/rETH with 50 $RPL per 28 day cycle per L2 Incentivize bonder liquidity with 12k $HOP per 28 day cycle per L2 Roll out bridging support for rETH on Hop Notes: After discussion with the HOP team, the amount of $RPL that we suggest be matched by $HOP is approximately $25,000/year/chain equivalent at time of writing.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a proposal from the Rocket Pool Incentive Committee to encourage faster bridging support for rETH (a liquid staking token) between Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum L1.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary The London Business School (LBS) Blockchain Society, in alliance with Flipside Governance FranklinDAO the University of Michigan and Columbia University proposes to institute a gas fee rebate mechanism for recognised delegates voting on-chain on Aave. Motivation Gas fees on Ethereum have been increasing recently. As shown by data from Dune Analytics, median gas prices sit at around 30 gwei, with intradaily spikes often far exceeding that level. The amount of gas fees required for voting on-chain has therefore risen proportionally, increasing the cost of on-chain governance for delegates (particularly in light of the heavier recent proposal load at Aave) ![|537x363]([link]) To find out more about gas costs on Aave, refer to the following dashboards created by Flipside here: [link] [link] [link] [link] LBS Blockchain Society, like other peer universities, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that depends on sponsorships and stipends to finance its operations. We currently receive monthly compensation for participating in MakerDAO governance, but otherwise receive no other form or income. Other schools like FranklinDAO (Penn Blockchain) are in very similar states. So far, we have been using this to cover gas costs at Aave, but the cost of on-chain governance remains a growing concern for us. In light of this, we see rebating delegates for their participation as having the following benefits: Incentivise more active engagement of the delegate community by removing the disincentive to vote. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for Aave. Create a more diverse voter base that includes student organisations such as ours. Reducing the barrier to entry for voting creates a more open, collaborative delegate ecosystem. This in turn drives participation. Retain the best delegates to drive growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being a great Aave delegate should not be at a net cost to the delegate with regards to spending ever-increasing gas costs. Achievable at relatively low cost. We also outline measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave below. Specification Participation Criteria To incentivise maximal voter participation, we propose a participation-based rebate system. Participation is defined by the proportion of proposals, being the sum total of Snapshot polls and AIPs, voted on by a Recognized Delegate over the lesser of: 1) the previous 90 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. A Participation score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted on all polls and AIPs over this period. Moreover, only delegate platforms with 10k+ AAVE in voting power will be eligible for gas fee rebates, in order to avoid spam - the 10k is a small enough number to allow for enough delegate participation but filters out any spam. Note: A Recognized Delegate is one with an Aave Delegate Platform, such as the LBS Blockchain Society, University of Michigan, FranklinDAO, Flipside, Llama, Aave Chan Initiative, Stablelabs, etc. The list of Recognized Delegates is open to change over time. A list of Aave Delegate Platforms can be found here, but note that there are a few new platforms and all of them may not have the required 10k AAVE voting power. |Participation Rate over Previous 90 days|Gas Rebate| | --- | --- | |>80%|100%| |50% to 80%|50%| |<50%|0%| Claiming Process To reduce the administrative burden for Aave, we propose the claiming process should be initiated by Recognized Delegates themselves. Every month, Recognized Delegates have the option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to Aave, which shall include: 1. The list of transactions associated with voting on Aave proposals over that month 2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction 3. Etherscan links detailing the above Delegates can also choose to batch their Gas Rebate Applications (i.e. submit a single application for multiple months) However, any gas fees not claimed over a 12 month period will be automatically forfeited. Once an application has been submitted to Aave, an appointed Governance Facilitator will review the applications and submit an AIP to pay out the gas fees. To that end, we have created a Dune dashboard that the Governance Facilitator can use to calculate the gas costs paid by a specific address, i.e., the address used by delegates to vote. The dashboard can be found [here]([link]) Initially, we propose that the Aave Chan Initiative plays the role of Governance Facilitator. To calculate the participation rate for delegates, we recommend using the following formula: Number of Proposals Voted on Since First Vote / Total Number of Proposals Since First Vote For example, assume a Delegate Platforms first vote was on Jan 1 2023. If they apply for a gas rebate on Feb 1 2023, and there have been 20 proposals between Jan 1 and Feb 1, out of which the Delegate has voted for 17 proposals, their participation rate is 85% We are working to publish a tool to easily calculate participation rate for the Governance Facilitator and will update this post once it is ready. We propose the funds to be paid from the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract, but defer to the community for guidance on the most appropriate source of funds. Gas Rebate Token We consider two options for the Gas Rebate Token: 1) ETH, the native asset in which gas fees are paid, and 2) stablecoins (e.g. USDC, DAI) The list of holdings in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract can be found [here]([link]) Each option above has associated trade-offs (for example certain assets may be deemed more strategic than others, or represent larger existing holdings) We would welcome community feedback on the most appropriate asset in advance of voting.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nThis proposal is a collaboration between LBS Blockchain Society, Michigan Blockchain and Flipside Crypto Simple Summary As Aave grows, there is a need for more advanced features that ensure the privacy and security of participants. Private voting is one such feature that would help to accomplish this goal. Making use of [partial private voting]([link]) within the Snapshot platform (shielded voting) will enhance Aaves governance and voters - leading to more fair and accurate results in the Snapshot stage. Shielded voting allows voters to hide their votes during the duration of the voting process and reveal their choices and results after the vote concludes. We propose that the community votes to turn on the private voting module for a two-month trial period, which can be reverted by the community and Space administrators at any time. This allows Aave to judge the efficacy of shielded voting in Snapshot and serve as a leader for Governance in other DAOs in adapting, experimenting, and innovating with new mechanisms. Motivation Aave Governance features both on-chain and off-chain voting. In the signal stage, Snapshot, votes have become decided by a few voters without many diversions. After speaking with other delegates, we recognize these outcomes and votes may not always reflect the true wishes of the community; it has become political. An example from Shutters blog of how the current process could be political, is below: Consider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don't have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus, they will be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion. Aaves Snapshot space must be a place for honesty and candid feedback; without these values, the space becomes redundant and leads to burnout [proposal coming soon.] By shielding the individual votes, it encourages voters of different sizes and opinions to participate and feel empowered, leading the DAO toward a more fair outcome. Snapshot has recently introduced Shielded voting, announced[here]([link]) Shielded voting has four keys benefits: 1. Prevents voter intimidation or coercion 2. Prevent early voters' decisions from influencing the decisions of later voters, thus reduce herding behavior and encourage independent thinking. 3. Protects participants' privacy by ensuring that their voting preferences are not exposed 4. Enhances the overall security and integrity of the Snapshot platform by making it more difficult for bad actors to interfere with the voting process A [demo]([link]) reveals a minimal change in the Snapshot UI: ![|187x385]([link]) ![|384x381]([link]) This functionality is powered by Shutter Network. Specification The steps for upgrading a Snapshot space to Shielded voting are as follows: -> admin of the \"Aave space go to the settings page in the \"Voting section -> choose Shutter as a privacy option and click \"Save -> all proposals from then on will use shielded voting. The community may disable this feature anytime. The current list of Snapshot admins is as follows: @monetsupply @MarcZeller [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] Success Criteria The time period the below criteria will be considered over will be 2 months prior to private voting being enabled vs. 2 months from when the time it is enabled. Average spread between YES to NO votes Number of unique voters voting Difference between outcomes of the votes, i.e., what % of votes result in YES For each of these criteria, success is when the average spread between YES to NO votes reduces, the number of unique voters increases, and there is greater variety in the outcome of the votes. These outcomes would indicate increased and more thorough engagement across the community.

Thank you! Summary: Aavegotchi DAO members provide extraordinary support to the DAO. They could provide even more - and better - support if they are thanked for their valuable DAO contributions with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note! We propose a 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot to thank (reward and recognize) valuable contributions to Aavegotchi DAO with $GHST + an on-chain thank you note. We'll do it in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain, and protects against bots and bad actors. The impact of rewarding Aavegotchi DAO members for your value-creating contributions should be greater efficiency, utility, and value for Aavegotchi DAO as well as more shared ownership in our community. During pilot, we will test 3 different rewards formats in 3 1-month \"seasons: Season 1: 15k total $GHST raffled to 30 winners. Each contribution you make to the DAO earns you \"raffle tickets. Season 2: 15k total $GHST rewarding each valuable contribution you make. Season 3: 15k total $GHST rewarding you in rarity-farming style. At the culmination of the third month, the community will vote on which rewards format you prefer. If a follow-up proposal passes to continue our pilot for an additional 3 months, rewards for the second pilot will be in the winning format. ![ApeCoin_-[image]]([link]) Rationale: We are deeply aligned with Aavegotchis work to enable true asset ownership for gamers at the protocol level. The excitement of this work is palpable in every community event and call we've been a part of since the beginning. To continue pushing this work forward, we must incentivize valuable contributions across our DAO in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain (transparent), and protects against bots and bad actors. While Thank Aavegotchi can automate limitless valuable DAO activity, we propose to start by focusing on rewarding metaverse and governance activities most valued by the Aavegotchi DAO community - which we've served in weekly Aavegotchi DAO & ThriveCoin Discord conversations. Sample contributions suggested by the community are included in the slide below: ![ApeCoin_-[image]]([link]) Rewarding Value To ensure we only reward valuable contributions, ThriveCoin - the tech powering Thank Aavegotchi - provides five layers of bot and bad actor protection: o Granular community control over rewarded activities o System designed to incentivize concentration of activity within one account o System can flexibly shift validation criteria in alignment with community needs o Delayed review and reward states supporting additional layers of detection Spectrum of oversight for reward verification Case Study ThriveCoin has been supporting Bankless DAO across two seasons. During this time, we have experienced broad adoption and support, and we have increased core user engagement across the DAO. Below are just a few examples: o 182% seasonal increase in Bankless DAO members using ThriveCoin o 89% increase in recognized contributions made across Bankless DAO o 41% increase in contributions from top 50 Bankless DAO members Team ![image]([link]) We think about the team in two ways: Thank Aavegotchi Advisory Board: [The first board selection will occur after this proposal passes the sig-prop. Top contributors have expressed the desire to nominate themselves and/or others for the board positions.] The Thank Aavegotchi board oversees Thank Aavegotchi - from choosing contributions rewarded to choosing reward amounts. Their job is to look at data, get feedback from the community, and continuously iterate to better serve the community. The board role requires 1 to 3 hours of work a week. Because this is work in support of the community, board members will be compensated at a TBD rate proposed and ratified in a community vote (e.g. they will not choose their own compensation) Additionally, as suggested on our weekly Aavegotchi & ThriveCoin Discord community calls, board members will hold their roles for six months at a time, and one board member will be selected from each of the seven community pillars included in the slide above. ThriveCoin: The ThriveCoin team will implement and maintain all the technology onboarding, implementation, and support. Additionally, we will hold community calls on the Aavegotchi Discord server in which we offer expertise, best practices, and feedback. ThriveCoins tech supports ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and other top DAO communities. We are web3 natives, VC funded, and have been working with Aavegotchi members for months to ensure this proposal is aligned with community needs. Timeline: o March and April: Feedback on Discord/Discourse. o Late April / early May: Snapshot Proposal sig-prop and core-prop passed. o June: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format I o July: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format II o August: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format III o Monthly: Review contribution data; optimize contributions and rewards. o Monthly: Ongoing support, best practices, bot, bad actor, sybil protection. o Monthly: 10% increase invaluable metaverse and governance contributions. ![ApeCoin_-[image]]([link]) Goals: Our goal with Thank Aavegotchi is to ensure that every community member is thanked for their valuable contributions to the DAO with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note. This should drive more efficiency, utility, and value in the community. To measure the success of Thank Aavegotchi, baseline contribution data will be established and will be tracked throughout the initiative. We will provide monthly reports on our progress, and share successes and learning as we go. Additionally, we have a set of tech-provision milestones: - Launch Thank Aavegotchi within one month of grant - 20+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute at launch - 50+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute 3 months after launch - 99% uptime of Thank Aavegotchi webpage and supporting services Specifications During our 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot, we will reward value-creating contributions to the community across web3, web2, and IRL. Valuable contributions can exist across many dozens of platforms, including those on the slide below and many more! ![image]([link]) We will use the ThriveCoin technology to do the following: 1. Auto-validate contributions: -Auto-validate activities across all relevant platforms -Granular control over which activities to reward -Platform-specific quality control filters to greatly reduce fraud risk 2. Auto-thank contributors on-chain: -Auto-record contributions on the Mumbai network, Polygon chain -Auto-log in IPFS file (blockchain storage) referenced in on-chain record 3. Auto-reward contributors with $GHST and charitable contributions: -Contributions will occur within one Season of three months -Contributors receive their $GHST rewards at the end of the Season Impact: Thank Aavegotchi should result in an increase in valuable DAO contributions, as determined by community members. Sustainability Goal + Benefits to Aavegotchi DAO: Assuming the initiative is a success, we will help create a self-sustaining rewards system that can fund itself without continuous grants from the DAO-treasury. We are developing such a system with ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and others, and we are excited to propose it after the first few successful months of our work together. Risks + Potential Consequences: Overall, Thank Aavegotchi is designed to be a low-risk way of exploring the impact of thanking Aavegotchi members for their valuable contributions to the DAO. $GHST is only allocated upon performance - including performance milestones ThriveCoin must achieve. We understand the importance of good stewardship of treasury funds. Overall Cost + Alternative Paths: The cost for the Thank Aavegotchi pilot is 18,000 $GHST a month for 3 months. The cost is performance-based. There is enormous upside if we can drive greater value for the DAO. There is little financial risk. 1. 100% performance-based. Rewards are distributed at the end of each month (Season) after contributions are made. 2. Up to 15,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed back to community members who make valuable contributions. 3. Up to 3,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed to ThriveCoin for milestone achievement. The cost includes all tech, white-labeling, integrations, 24/7 support, and extensive customization. 4. Two weeks before successful completion of the pilot, a proposal will be submitted to support one 3-month extension on the pilot. 5. If we've had two successful pilots together, we will submit one final proposal to ensure Thank Aavegotchi continues to drive sustainable, ongoing value for our community! Alternative: the same concept, structure, and cost above, but using Alchemica tokens as the rewards in addition to $GHST. We will coordinate with the community to request community-desired amounts in $FUD, $FOMO, $ALPHA, $KEK and $GLTR. Final thoughts Thank Aavegotchi allows Aavegotchi DAO members to be thanked (rewarded and recognized) for your valuable contributions to the DAO. The impact should be more excitement, more efficiency, and more value for our DAO. This pilot is a performance-based grant. It uses ~0.05% of the Aavegotchi DAO treasury, most of which goes to value-contributing Aavegotchi DAO members. Its a small investment that has the opportunity to pay off very, very big. ![image]([link]) Snapshot Signaling Proposal Time: 7 Days Total proposal is for 54,000 GHST (currently $59,400 in USDC) with the vast majority allocated directly back to the Aavegotchi DAO community.

Background: Olympus will be bringing the native OHM Token Cross Chain to Arbitrum One. In support of this, pools of liquidity must be established and funded to create a low friction base to build from. Olympus DAO has evaluated the existing landscape and prepared recommendations on how to most effectively position our assets on-chain to support this effort. Proposal: Request community approval to establish the following: - Initial POL: Initial Pools will be seeded in amounts not to exceed, 5mm each. - Pool Types: Two pools will be created - OHM/USDC and OHM/wETH - Pool Locations: Balancer (Though discussions and terms with alternative DEXs are ongoing. Balancer allows us continued exposure to AURA where we have been accumulating governance power) Notes: USDC was selected as the stable pairing asset after evaluating the volumes on Arbitrum One. DAI volume was too low to have it act as a core liquidity pair. There has also been exploration into a potential 3Pool using LUSD in the future. As our presence matures, iterations can strategically be made through discrete OIPs. Assets used to assemble this LP will be extracted from existing LP on Mainnet. As of the time of writing, 10m OHM/wETH has been unwrapped, the ETH from which will be used to create the wETH Position. FRAXBP will be unwrapped to create FRAX which will be swapped for the USDC position. Furthermore, creating this liquidity will require a bridging event to occur to get the Non-OHM assets on to the Arbitrum One chain. As of the time of writing, we have roughly $934k of wETH already on chain so the difference will be bridged using a high quality protocol to move assets of size. The USDC will will be bridged as well OHM will be transferred (Mint and Burned) via the the newly deployed custom Cross Chain v3 Contracts an then LP will be assembled from these assets.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal is about establishing two liquidity pools (OHM/USDC and OHM/wETH) on Balancer to support Olympus' presence in the Arbitrum One ecosystem.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nBrief intro about Galxe: Galxe is the leading platform for building Web3 communities. With over 65 million registered Galxe ID users, Galxe has propelled the growth of Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more than 2100 partners with reward-based loyalty programs. Protocols can leverage Web3 credentials from Galxes credential data network to power marketplace growth, issue Soul Bound Tokens, increase community engagement, boost ecosystem growth, and generate brand awareness as a result. Galxe is a team of growth experts that has powered the on-chain and off-chain growth of our 2100+ ecosystem partners. An organic community of over 65M+ Galxe ID users and 150K+ DAU make Galxe the go-to platform for growth and retention in Web3. In addition, Galxe has become the one and only discover-to-earn protocol for users with a variety of different ecosystems running growth and retention campaigns daily. At Galxe, we've integrated 15 different blockchains with NFT minting functionality that include non-evm chains such as Aptos and Solana. Stargate has a great opportunity to engage both the evm and non-evm users of Galxe to the Stargate ecosystem with the objective in mind of converting those users into long-term loyal users of Stargate. Galxes success has put us among the top dapps in the space. According to DappRadar, Galxe has consistently become a top 10 dapp based on unique active wallets over the course of a 30-day period. Issue Statement: Growth and marketing in Web3 are difficult and many projects struggle to find ways to build their community, drive on-chain activity, and re-engage with users following their first interaction. Galxe helps you tap into the most diverse Web3 user base to find the perfect user for your protocol. We accomplish this by leveraging credentials and helping you identify your loyal users, so you can reward them accordingly. Our ecosystem of 2100+ partners and 65M+ Galxe ID users allows us to assist a variety of protocols in achieving incredible growth. This includes Optimism and the participating dapps in the Optimism Quest, such as Stargate. Solution: Galxe is looking to team up with Stargate to run a series of campaigns to educate users on Stargates Optimism ecosystem, target new user growth, and introduce Stargates first on-chain loyalty program on Galxe. The quests will include touching each part of the Stargate ecosystem to make sure users are familiar with everything Stargate has to offer on Optimism including but not limited to transferring, pooling, and farming on Stargate through Optimism. Educational quests will prioritize understanding Stargate and Optimism for a better user experience. Users will consume educational content from blogs to videos. Whats exciting is that Stargate has the ability to draw users from all parts of the Galxe ecosystem that Stargate may have not had exposure to yet during the quests. Stargate will grow its community and power its on-chain growth on Optimism through Galxe campaigns. Galxes past success in the Optimism ecosystem has made this proposed partnership feel like the perfect fit. The Optimism Quest, hosted by Galxe, drove the Optimism ecosystem to new heights, resulting in strong retention of Optimism. New user growth on Optimism increased by 47% and specifically on Stargate by 106% Stargates quest asked users to bridge USDC to or from Optimism which resulted in 337,000+ NFTs being minted. Galxe and Optimism accomplished the objectives of new user growth, mass adoption, and retention. Throughout this 4 month quest, there were over 3.4M+ NFTs minted on Optimism through Galxe. Galxe recently powered a Stargate quest in the Polygon ecosystem that also achieved strong results. Out of the 26 other dapps in the quest, Stargate attracted the most users and had the most NFTs minted. Over 14,600+ NFTs were minted and over 230,000+ users visited the Stargate campaign page alone. Execution: Galxe will work directly with the Stargate team to asses growth goals and objectives over the course of a 4-month period. The objectives set forth by the Stargate team will guide the execution of each campaign including Galxes marketing initiatives. Through the quests, Galxe can put in place a realm of gamification methods like no other. This includes transferable/non-transferable NFTs, generating Stargates own personal NFT collection, incorporating gamified NFT minting by using our Mystery Box module, and introducing Stargates on-chain loyalty program on Optimism powered by Galxe and its new loyalty points feature. Participation badges and loyalty levels inside the Stargate Optimism ecosystem will be achievable throughout the Galxe campaigns. Stargate will be able to identify loyalty, shine a spotlight on their most important quests through loyalty points and reward their most loyal users accordingly. This gives the opportunity for the end user to build out their own reputation in the Stargate ecosystem through NFTs, credentials, and loyalty points. Stargate and Galxe plan to run quests for users of all different levels in the crypto ecosystem to make sure no user is left behind and there is an opportunity for the inclusion of all. Each user will receive gas fee rebates for participating in the quests essentially making the campaigns a gasless experience. Timeline and costs: Galxe can begin working with Stargate on campaigns and growth initiatives immediately since Optimism is already integrated into Galxe. Planning will start after the passed proposal and once objectives have been finalized between the teams. Galxe will launch a series of coordinated campaigns to support Stargate objectives and the Optimism ecosystem. The only costs to be considered will come from the marketing side as Galxe will support this initiative with custom, tailored content across all of our social channels for maximum exposure. Marketing support will include being featured on Galxes front page carousel, receiving retweets/announcement tweets from the Galxe main Twitter page of 750K+ followers, Discord/Telegram communication, a dedicated blog post, and an AMA. Galxe Twitter ([link]): 750K+ (Verified) Galxe Discord ([link]): 450K+ Summary: Galxe will leverage its expertise in propelling the growth of the Stargate Optimism ecosystem. Top-tier marketing support will be provided by Galxe and we're expecting this quest to receive maximum engagement. This initiative can begin right away after the passing of the proposal and OP tokens will be distributed to users to reimburse them for gas costs. Additionally, OP tokens will be used in a reward pool to incentivize and reward participation based on user engagement levels in the quests. Galxe is requesting a total of 45,000 OP tokens. 10% will be used for the marketing and promotion of the campaign while the remaining 90% will be left over for the reimbursement of OP gas fees and as a rewards pool for participation.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about Galxe partnering with Stargate to create a series of campaigns and growth initiatives over the course of 4 months.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nProposal Motivation We [Michigan Blockchain]([link]) are submitting this proposal to reinstate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Polkadots EVM-compatible parachain, Moonbeam. Last spring, the Uniswap DAO voted on this exact topic. The proposal advanced through Unis governance rails, receiving positive [feedback from the community]([link]), progressing past the [temperate check]([link]), and eventually passing with a near unanimous YES decision during the [onchain vote]([link]) Nomad was the designated contract deployer and the appointed cross-chain messaging solution for that proposal. Illusory Systems (Nomad) received the Additional Use Grant, which can be seen on the [v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth ENS subdomain]([link]) Although Nomad obtained the license exemption in May 2022, they never began v3 contract deployment on Moonbeam. This can generally be seen as fortuitous from Uniswaps vantage point as the hiatus allowed Uniswap to avoid exposure to the [Nomad bridge exploit]([link]) on August 1, 2022. Recently, both the [Uniswap]([link]) and [Moonbeam]([link]) communities have voiced interest in reinstating the previous proposal. As a result, we have conversed with key members of the Moonbeam ecosystem to formulate a reformed proposal with a couple of modifications to the previous proposal. This new proposal will contain updates regarding the architecture and activity on both Polkadot and Moonbeam. The previous $2.5M commitment by the Moonbeam foundation to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has been omitted due to difficult market conditions, but there are liquidity incentives available through [Moonbeam Foundations Level 3]([link]) grant process. This has the potential to qualify for the mentioned grant over the course of the next few months, allowing for more seamless liquidity bootstrapping on Moonbeam. Moonbeam, Polkadot, and How Uniswap Benefits One of the key selling points for Uniswaps deployment onto Moonbeam is the potential for the DEX to attain market share in the broader Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot Relay Chain At the heart of Polkadot lies the Relay Chain, a layer-0 blockchain with limited bells and whistles, lacking native support for smart contracts. The purpose of the Relay Chain is to serve as a simplistic centerpiece into which other blockchains integrate. Layer-1 blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain are called parachains. Each parachain has autonomy over its architecture with a native token, collator set (collators are just validators for a parachain), and governance system. The Polkadot Relay Chain uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, making it responsible for the crucial task of handling the ecosystems security. The chains [staking ratio currently sits at 47%]([link]) (~$4B DOT out of $7.6B DOT mcap) which indicates that nearly half of the token supply is involved in securing Polkadot. Parachain collators aren't directly responsible for security but are vital for aggregating parachain txns into a block candidate, along with a respective state transition proof, for the Relay Chain to validate. Offloading consensus responsibilities to the Relay Chain liberates parachains and lets them divert their resources and efforts to designing and maintaining specialized L1s like Moonbeam. Moonbeam: Polkadots Go-to EVM-Compatible Parachain Moonbeam was inaugurated as Polkadots second parachain after it [won a parachain slot auction]([link]) in Q4 2021. Parachain slots are the limited number of seats present on the Relay Chain. Each slot is occupied by a particular project for a lease period of two years. Currently, [43]([link]) out of the [100 maximum slots]([link]) are filled. In order for a parachain slot to become occupied, a project must win a slot auction: a 7-day bidding process during which multiple projects compete to attain a seat on the Relay Chain. The project that bids the most DOT tokens bonds (locks up) the bidded tokens for the duration of slot lease. Bonded tokens are returned post lease expiration. To ease the financial burden of self-funding large bids, projects vie for DOT holders' contributions to crowdfund their bid. Moonbeam received a total of [35,759,931 DOT from ~200k contributors]([link]), the highest number of tokens committed for any parachain auction. As a reward, DOT contributors received Glimmer ($GLMR), the native Moonbeam token responsible for rewarding collators, network txn fees, and governance. The sheer number of contributors made GLMRs distribution decentralized. XCM & Interoperability Along with security, the second core function of the Relay Chain is providing trustless interoperability between parachains. The sharing of state and validation logic enables a trustless ecosystem. Individual parachains do not have a reliance on trusting other parachains and can instead depend on the Relay Chain. The specific railway for sending assets and messages to parachains via the Relay Chain is called XCMP, which utilizes a standardized communication format called XCM. This is Polkadots way of enabling a versatile cross-chain environment, as XCM is not only limited to parachains but can also be utilized by non-Substrate chains. XCM went live May 2022, the same month that the previous Moonbeam RFC was released. It has since [relayed ~235k messages]([link]) Parity Technologies is constantly iterating on XCMs functionalities, with [XCM v3 launching soon]([link]) Moonbeam currently [leads all other parachains]([link]) in terms of cross-parachain txns via XCM channels. Over 2/3 of the top XCM channels involve transfers either to or from Moonbeam, illustrating the parachains high usage in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam also leveraged XCM to create the XC-20 token standard. XC-20 tokens are essentially Substrate assets that conform to the ERC-20 interface. This is a game changer for Uniswap. Since Uni uses ERC-20 tokens, the DEX struggles to accommodate non-ERC-20 tokens like Substrate native tokens. If a user wants to create a DOT/ETH pool, for instance, this is not possible due to DOTs incompatibility with Uniswaps ERC-20 requirement. Utilizing xcDOT, the XC-20 version of DOT, fixes this issue. This interoperability between parachains will expose Uniswap to the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Uniswaps presence on Moonbeam will likely become a beacon for users and developers to access liquidity more seamlessly. The transfer of assets and data from Ethereum to Moonbeam to other parachainsand vice versawould facilitate the overall growth of Polkadot and Uniswap. Developers and Ecosystem As of Q4 2022, Polkadot saw its [full-time developer count]([link]) increase to 752, trailing only behind Ethereum. This is in part due to the ease of using the Substrate framework. The rate of growth was on par with Ethereum but lagged behind competing chains like Cosmos and Solana. A more holistic measure of growth would also include the activity present on Polkadots canary chain, Kusama, which saw a 21% increase in full-time developers. Prior to launching on Polkadot, projects tend to launch a version of their chain on Kusamawhich is not a testnet but a fully sovereign chainto battle test their product. Kusama hosts a very similar Relay Chain-Parachain architecture to mimic the conditions of Polkadot. Moonbeams sister chain on Kusama is called Moonriver. Moonbeam itself saw a full-time developer growth rate of 39% Moonbeam is only second to Acala in terms of parachain TVL, with $46.5M spread across 44 different protocols. Due to the ease with which Ethereum developers can launch their EVM dapps onto the parachain, Moonbeam boasts the largest quantity of applications in the Polkadot ecosystem. The DEX market on Moonbeam is largely uncontested, with StellaSwap absorbing most of the parachains TVL. With capital efficient liquidity pools and strong brand recognition, Uniswaps expansion into the Moonbeam ecosystem will very likely enable it to capture market share from StellaSwap and also attract new usersthe goal is not for this to be a zero-sum game. Timeline This proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. The current temperature check is purposed for assessing the DAOs desire to deploy on Moonbeam. If this Snapshot passes, then we will commence the finalization of the relevant stakeholders mentioned in the RFC. Again, this temp check is only measuring the communitys desire to deploy on Moonbeam--its not a vote on the stakeholder list. Stakeholder debates are to take place in the Uniswap Forums. After the community is content with the stakeholders (decided in forums) AND has shown a desire to deploy on Moonbeam (decided by this temp check), an onchain vote will begin.

Abstract This publications seeks to increase the Supply Cap using Chaos Labs on-chain liquidity methodology to either to 19.6M or 29.3M. Increasing the Supply Cap will enable users to continue depositing MaticX, earn SD rewards and enter the recursive MaticX/wMATIC yield strategy. Stader Labs is currently offering SD rewards to user who deposit MaticX. This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave. Motivation Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below details various proposals reflecting Llamas efforts to date: [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market]([link]) [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update]([link]) [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool]([link]) [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool]([link]) [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade]([link]) [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3]([link]) This proposal is a continuation of the above work. The below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. !([link]]) !([link]]) The chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth. Using the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology]([link]) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. !([link]]) !([link]]) Ratio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100% With reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework]([link]) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aaves exposure to MaticX over time.

It features 10 000 Luchadores NFT, each of which can be played in the game. Since the start, the Luchadores team has adhered to a \"purist ideal: the NFTs are fully onchain (svg art), attributes were allocated with provable randomness thanks to ChainLink VRF, and the game itself will live onchain too. A flash of Luchadores history Luchadores NFT - mint_init 17/05/2021; mint_end 18/08/2021 The Luchadores NFT were launched on 17 May 2021, with 10 000 Luchadores mintable for 2 LINK (VRF price) + gas costs in ETH. It took about three months for the full collection to be minted, with a sizable interest spike as the end of the mint was approaching. LUCHA token launch 23/12/2021 In December 2021, the LUCHA token was released on the Polygon network. 6,18% of the total supply was allocated to Luchadores NFT holders over 1 year. The amount of LUCHA tokens earned daily per Luchadores NFT owned depends on their rarity. Other incentives were distributed for tournament winners (prizes), and soon to be earned in the game. Pi\u00f1atas pinata_1_init: 31/01/2022; pinata_1_end: 01/02/2022 Pi\u00f1atas are ERC-1155 NFTs on Polygon containing random accessories for Luchadores. The first round of pi\u00f1atas sold out in less than two days, as fellow Luchadores were hungry for gear. LUCHA_yield_extension ([LIP-2]([link])) 15/12/2022 The daily yield allocated to Luchadores holders was extended for a one-year period with the LIP-2 vote LUCHA_yield_clawback ([LIP-3]([link])) 21/02/2023 & POL_strategy 24/03/2023 ([LIP-4]([link])) 14 months after the token release, and because of the LIP-2 results, the DAO decided to redeem the unclaimed $LUCHA of the first year and use it to fund the POL strategy. 2,25% of the total supply was retrieved (over the 6,18% for the first year rewards) and allocated to liquidity and vote incentives. Tournaments To date, 3 tournaments have been organized, offering a unique opportunity for Luchadores to prove their skills in the arena. Interested players can register their Luchadores, select their desired statistics and skills, and thats it! The grids are generated randomly; the matches are played automatically, and the player can check the results of his Luchadores the next day. Luchadores who perform well in tournaments can earn pi\u00f1atas, LUCHA, accessories, and even Luchadores NFT. VRF full on-chain game, Independent team, no pre-mint, no team allocation. Motivation After more than one year of existence, the LUCHA token is now widely distributed; with the Fight-to-Earn component launch approaching, the team is also looking to improve the liquidity situation beforehand. Thanks to LIP-3 and LIP-4 votes, the total liquidity available on the pool increased massively, with the vast majority of it being protocol-owned. The LUCHA/wMATIC Balancer pool is already the main pool to exchange the token, and its importance will accrue. Side/Arbitrage pools are also available: - [ComethSwap LUCHA/wMATIC]([link]) - [ComethSwap LUCHA/MUST]([link]) - [Satin Exchange LUCHA/WMATIC]([link]) - [Satin Exchange LUCHA/CASH]([link]) The Luchadores DAO owns a majority of the LUCHA-WMATIC LP (87% of the TVL is POL) and will accumulate & relock the rewards earned to build strategic holdings which will be used to vote on the gauge and sustain the strategy voted on [LIP-4]([link]) Additionally, the LIP-4 also approved a budget to create vote incentives on Warden Quest to attract more veBAL & other wrappers voting power while building the DAO voting power. Independent vlAURA holders have also expressed their intent to support the voting on the gauge if obtained in its early days. The governance is also considering switching the LUCHA staking model to a veLUCHA one, where holders can stake (and, if they want, lock) LUCHA/wMATIC BPT tokens to earn MASK, the non-transferable in-game currency, BAL rewards, and other benefits. Note: The initial post for this gauge was the [[BIP-242]]([link]), which is resubmitted on this proposal. Considering the last results, there were discussions between the Luchadores Team, the Balancer Maxi and Aura delegates to share more informations on the project & the goals of this proposal for the Lucha DAO.The Balancer Maxi and Aura delegates are amenable to a new vote. Specifications 1. Governance: There is no on-chain governance as the game and the token are still at an early stage. Voting via Snapshot covers treasury and token-related decisions, executed through a 2/4 multi-sig. As development progresses, the game and its related infrastructure will be increasingly on-chain (Polygon) 2. Oracles: The Luchadores do not rely on external oracles. 3. Audits: The LUCHA token is a standard ERC-20 token 4. Centralization vectors: The multisig mentioned above is the main centralization vector in the current stage. While the Luchadores NFT is built for resilience, the LUCHA token requires more guardrails until the game is finetuned and fight to earn is launched. 5. Market history: After significant volatility at first, the LUCHA price stabilized while the initial supply was being distributed. 6.

Note: reviewing and providing feedback on the preset update payload would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us. Motivation Per [BIP-103]([link]), karpatkey has been tasked with deploying yield-generating strategies using a portion of the existing funds in the treasury in a risk-adjusted, trust-minimised, and non-custodial manner. A new SAFE owned by the BalancerDAO was created, a Manager preset was applied to allow a specific subset of transactions and the in-scope funds were transferred. More details can be found in [this post]([link]) Since February, karpatkey has been managing the treasury portfolio, and [weekly reports]([link]) are published on the forum. As we anticipated, the permissions preset is an evolving configuration that needs to be adjusted regularly. In this first update request, we are looking to fulfill the following objectives: To further improve the efficiency of the swaps, we request the BalancerDAO to introduce new permissions to the preset allowing swapping on Uniswap v3 using the 'exactInputSingle' function, which is expected to provide alternative swapping routes that will yield better results.

Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal.

The purpose of this increase is to mitigate the risk of malicious or spammy proposals. Abstract Historically, any ShapeShift user who held a minimum of 100 FOX could create a proposal on SnapShot. On April 12th, 2023, 4 spam proposals were created that did not follow the official FOX Governance Process and were subsequently removed. To prevent the ongoing \"attack, the threshold was proactively increased to 10,000 FOX and an announcement was sent in Discord as well as through ShapeShifts Push Channel to notify community members. Motivation By increasing the amount of FOX Voting power required to make a proposal, the community can make it more costly/difficult to publish malicious or spammy proposals to ShapeShifts SnapShot space. Specification ShapeShifts SnapShot Space was already updated to increase the minimum required FOX Voting Power to publish a proposal from 100 to 10,000 FOX. This was done proactively to protect against an ongoing \"attack of the same invalid proposal that had been posted and removed 4 times in the same day. If this proposal passes, the increase to 10,000 FOX will remain in place. If this proposal is rejected, the change would be reverted and the threshold will go back to 100 FOX. Benefits By increasing the minimum amount of FOX required to make a proposal, we can ensure that only users with a significant stake in the ecosystem can make proposals and vote on them. This will help to maintain the quality of proposals and ensure that they align with the interests of the ShapeShift ecosystem as a whole. Additionally, it will reduce the likelihood of spam proposals and ensure that only serious proposals are submitted. As soon as the threshold was increased to 10,000, the spam proposal that was being posted repeatedly ceased being posted, suggesting that the 10,000 threshold is sufficient for now. Drawbacks 1. While this increases the cost of making a spam proposal, spam proposals will still be possible. The community can consider making an additional proposal in the future to require a minimum Gitcoin Passport score to add another layer of protection. 2. This increases the barriers for smaller FOX holders to make proposals.

To combat this, I decided to use a \"Virtual Weight for the figures, which allowed me to apply the 3x while still retaining the relative weight per pool, per period, to determine the value of rewards owed. The virtual weight calculations account for the 3x boost to APR through TVL rather than directly to APR, the same way the gauges do. This was a much more workable method of achieving the desired outcome of accounting for the 3x boost on locked TVL and how it affected rewards and thereby the Debt Liability in this proposal. I started with a MAX LOCK(3.0x) and utilized a linear decay (-0.013 every 7 days) for the boost calculations. (Additionally, I found a single figure where I incorrectly calculated the average price of FXS for a single period and have since corrected that.) Total $value$ upon emission of ALL rewards = $576,460.9796 = 23.2% (fee) Total USD of all FXS rewards emitted to 2.484m LP valued at time of emission, using Max Boost of 3.0 with linear decay : $208,481.0176 208,481.0176 / 2,484,000 = 8.39% I propose the 2.484m TVL within the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Pool be unlocked for a withdrawal fee equal to the USD-Value-at-time-of-Emission of ALL FXS rewarded to the (2.484m) LP in this pool (8.39% of 2.484m TVL) (+ slippage ~1.57%) = 10% FEE Vote - For: Implement the ragequit function for the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut gauge (10% fee) - Against: Do nothing.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about implementing a \"ragequit\" function for the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut gauge.

Forum post can be found [here]([link]) Abstract Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlets platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V2s Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Last November, we proposed interest rate curve changes for the Aave V2 Ethereum market using our interest rate curve optimization framework. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V2 Ethereum, and extends our methodology to Polygon and Avalanche. Objectives Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve: 1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool 2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future As a secondary objective, we want to optimize the user experience of Aaves borrowers and suppliers.

The role transitions Tylers product responsibilities to [hexadecimals]L over two weeks, supports ramping into the role, and proposes a revised budget from May 1st to August 15. This will alter budgets from SCP 119. Abstract - As a product-centric DAO, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is accountable for a number of activities acquiring / retaining users, growing the FOX ecosystem, and achieving Shapeshifts mission. The goal of this addendum is continuing stability, velocity, and success in the Product Workstream by extending its current timeline, and introducing budget renewal/revision. Nothing in the first two months is intended to change, the original governance approved roadmap continues. [hexadecimals]L will jump into phase 1b on the roadmap and ramp up hopefully to introduce a phase 2 kickoff from the original SCP. Motivation - Through the efforts of , , , , , , and , and [achieving the goals in Addendum]([link]) to SCP-119, I'm humbly submitting this proposal for joining the Shapeshift product team as the Workstream leader. I bring Shapeshift a diverse level of product and DeFi experience from centralized exchanges and building on protocols. I've been a product manager in a few different places namely MakerDAO, Rabbithole V1, and most recently Govrn; I've also had stints at OKCoin and Compound Finance. I've experienced product market fit a couple times, have sneaky Figma skills, and just generally am so excited to participate here. By supporting the Product Workstream in the four month budget (April15 - August 15) , the DAO can trial [hexadecimals]L as facilitator, continue building / rolling out new features, improving the user experience of our app, and move forward on user acquisition, retention, and product evolution. My immediate aim for the team is increasing product visibility, improving prioritization, and continuing the best in class experience that users have come to love. Specification - This proposal addendum identifies [hexadecimals]L as the new product workstream leader, onboards [hexadecimals]L into the role, and allots time for Tyler | Shapeshift to pivot back to previous responsibilities while finishing his interim post. Through this proposal, Tyler will actively work with the current Product Workstream Contributors & proposed Leader, starting with support and guidance but gradually transitioning responsibilities like: Admin, meeting leading and organization, task management, KPI and project tracking/reporting for the Shapeshift product roadmap. Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details. Shout out PTT for a lot of the legwork here. - Arranging phase 2 strategy talks, and getting the Phase 2 roadmap proposal posted to the forum and moved through governance. - Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week. - Product/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint. - Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas. - Draft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, work with [hexadecimals] to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process. - FBL will provide additional scope to the workstream lead role by synthesizing strategic outcomes for the product team, making phase 2 a reality, and guiding more day-to-day improvements for efficiency and alignment across workstreams. - FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development. - Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with marketing and other workstreams. - Hosting and Leading Spec breakdowns between Product and Engineering. Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness) - Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s. - , whos currently on retainer to make updates to shapeshift.com on an as needed basis will temporarily report in to Beard on a weekly basis to review needs, design work, etc KPIs from previous SCP: - Increase Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023 - March optimistic MAUs 27,616 - June optimistic MAUs: 56,713 - Increase our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30% - Triple the amount of average daily defi confirms by June 15 - Improve the new user experience and decrease our bounce rate (currently at 17.69%) - Secure Grant funding from 5 protocols by June 2023 - Maintain an NPS score of 35 of higher - We've been evaluating a different metric: PMF. Either way we will produce a report on satisfaction with Shapeshift. - Increase our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30% - Increase Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023 - March Minimum MAUs 22,500 - June Minimum MAUs 27,000 - Evaluate new KPIs mid June; especially focusing on sustainable revenue sharing models, future forecasts, and using data to double down on feature bets. - We might also [explore NCTs]([link]) a newer product framework for goal setting that may fit with our iterative approach. Execution looks like: - Representing the product and product workstream to both the ShapeShift and broader crypto community - Running consistent retros, learning the dev stack and providing actionable feature scope, revising and projecting the budget, and sequencing the roadmap into digestible phases. - Feature prioritization and partnership evaluation. - Curating & writing feature specifications (including goals and success metrics), UI/UX designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized by the ShapeShift DAO. - Updating and disseminating the roadmap via weekly calls. - Leading the product syncs in the SS discord.

Abstract On Polygon, there are two Aave deployments in production and the majority of the liquidity is deposited into the obsolete v2 deployment. With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and three communities actively distributing rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3. With a successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot vote, this publication has incorporated community feedback and presents three options for the community to select from. The key consideration is the upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign. This publication parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation. Motivation Currently, there are three communities distributing four tokens across Polygon v3. SD - Stader Labs LDO - Lido DAO MaticX & stMATIC - Polygon Foundation ![|717x331]([link]) This has led to Polygon v3 offering better deposit rates relative to v2. The charts below show the TVL for Polygon v3 since genesis, v3 for 2023 and v2 for 2023. During 2023 TVL in v3 is steadily increasing, the v2 markets TVL is more trending sideways with asset prices broadly trending sideways/higher. !([link]]) Liquidity Mining (LM) on v3 is helping to pull users across and the migration tool from BGD further supports this initiative. At TokenLogic, we believe more can be done to migrate users and it is better to do this whilst LM is ongoing. This publication at its core seeks to accelerate the migration of users from v2 to v3 whilst LM is ongoing. The [TEMP CHECK]([link]) received strong support from the community with 525k votes, 92.42%, in favor of implementing the change. This publication incorporated feedback from the comments on the previous governance forum post and now includes two additional reduced impact options for the community to consider. Incorporating feedback from the community, TokenLogic is presenting three options to the community for consideration. Options 1) and 2) include adjusting the Uoptimal and Reserve Factor (RF) parameters where as Option 3 includes only adjusting the RF parameter: Option 1 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Aggressive Reduce Uoptimal by 50.00% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same Maintain the same Slope2 gradient Option 2 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Conservative Reduce Uoptimal by 33.33% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same Maintain the same Slope2 gradient Option 3 - Increase RF Increase RF such that deposit yield is reduced by 20% The below table compares the outcome of Option 1, 2 and 3. ![|717x219]([link]) Implementing any of the three options above will further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3. Option 3 affects only deposit rates and thus increases the deposit rate differential between the markets as the borrowing rate remains unchanged on v2. Option 3 relies on depositors migrating liquidity, due to lower deposit rate, to increase the borrowing cost over time. Whereas Option 1 and 2 directly increase the borrowing cost for users whilst keeping deposit rates the same which encourages borrowers to migrate. Option 1 and 2 - leverage strategies and simply deposit to draw a loan users will experience higher borrowing rates. Structured leverage products will experience increased vol decay (deposit yield - borrowing yield - rebalancing/recentreing costs) Do note, the feasibility of structured 2x leverage products is more sensitive to LTV & LT changes, as reducing these parameters can break the strategy. Reducing the Uoptimal and increasing the RF means structured products remain viable, however, like all debt positions, there are higher holding costs over time. Option 3 impacts these products less as the collateral type is not normally stable coins and more likely to be high vol assets which typically have very low deposit rates. An example of Option 3, deposit wMATIC borrow USDC and swap for wMATIC for 2x leverage is affected by changing the RF as the deposit rate on wMATIC falls. But as wMATIC deposit rate is already low, 0.73% relative to 3.29% on v3. Increasing the RF from 20% to 36%, reducing deposit rate from 0.73% to 0.58%, 0.15%, will have less impact as increasing the borrowing costs on USDC from 2.99% to 3.40%, 0.41% via Option 2. Uoptimal Using Option 1 as an example, the revised Uoptimal parameter is the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value. Slope 2 By reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Option 1, the Slope 2 parameter changes from 75% to 124% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60% Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient. ![|68[hexadecimals]]([link] \"Chart\") Reserve Factor As a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased. This redirects interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors. Due to abnormally high USDT usage, 77.49% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins. Specification The tables below detail the proposed parameter changes to achieve the outcome defined in the table above. ![|717x219]([link]) ![|401x217]([link]) Prior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations.

I am capable of fulfilling the required duties but also beyond that I would use it as a platform to increase mainstream ENS adoption. How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token? This is an incomplete question because it does not specify who \"you\" is. If an SEC inquiry is addressed only to the Foundation itself, the correct answer is that the Foundation retain counsel and that counsel manage the inquiry. Should the definition of \"you\" be more broad, then any rational person should find my conditions stated below rational, reasonable, and necessary. They should be put in place regardless of who is chosen. Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination? Yes, if by chance I am selected, my acceptance of the role is conditional on: - The DAO authorizing the Foundation to set up D&O insurance; - The DAO authorizing the Foundation to compensate directors. Alex Van de Sande Twitter: Are you 18 years of age or older? Yes Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident? No Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories? No Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation? I won't lie: I believe this role is purely ceremonial and believe that as long as everything is working as intended, Directors should do nothing but rubberstamp what the DAO approves. But as a symbol, I do think its important for the Directors not to be all from ENS Labs, nor for them to be in any jurisdiction that is not welcome to Crypto and at this moment, the US is such jurisdiction. So thats it, thats the whole of my pitch: I do not work for ENS labs, I do not respond to them, nor do I am subject to US jurisdiction. I also have been in this space for the last 10 years and you can expect me to be around in the next 10 years. How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token? I am not not subject to american laws, but that doesn't mean I intend to break any of them, as I still intend to keep the privilege of landing in US soil. I still believe the US to be a reasonable thriving democracy that is just right now a bit on the wrong side of the pendulum. I also believe that the ENS airdrop was a great precedent on how to do token distribution to the community: no \"investor ever received it in the airdrop, because there were no investors in ENS before the airdrop. All that received them were either involved in the community or the development. If I ever received a request from the SEC of any other legal institutions from anywhere I would take the reasonable route: talk to my lawyer, open it with as much as possible with the community and, in an extreme case in which I believed I the requests would hurt ENS and I couldn't be open to talk about it, I would resign from the foundation.

This proposal would grant another three month initiative to continue growing Gearbox. Quarterly Review The primary objective of this first engagement period (Feb 1, 23 - Apr 31, 23) was to increase TVL. Before and during the engagement, myself and other Gearbox contributors discussed V2 with some funds and advisors, and we received feedback that the rates were not competitive enough to justify large deposits when the \"risk free rate was so close to what Gearbox yields offered. Institutional and TVL Engagement With this feedback in hand, I proceeded to pitch the Special LP Boost 1 discussion to 12 new (not previously engaged) venture funds, hedge funds, and family offices, however, only two institutional firms indicated interest in the opportunity. The main pushback around engagement was size required to participate, specifically in a macro environment where return of capital has been dominant over return on capital. As Gearbox has continued to show its safety and security, the \"institutional comfort has seemingly grown reputationally, but we have seen TVL decrease since the beginning of the period. I would attribute this trend to several factors including the uncertain global regulatory environment, the USDC depeg incident, and tangentially Nexus' V2 launch, which has caused insurance rates to go up, making depositing into Gearbox less appealing. Despite TVL now hovering near $90m, the protocols resilience has been clear and that narrative is resonating with larger players in the space. One highlight of the quarter was the Balancer Boosted Pools launching to deposit funds into Gearbox. I originally engaged with Balancer contributors in July 2022 to start discussing this integration. Fortunately, the Balancer team saw the opportunity and Gearboxs traction, and so they built out the entire boosted pool system, which is now currently being used to deposit ~$5m into Gearbox pools. Although $5m is just a start, this situation demonstrates the time required to evolve conversations into working relationships and a realized product showing results. Events In addition to focusing specifically on raising TVL, I've leveraged additional events to grow the network and get in front of users that haven't encountered Gearbox. I've added a bullet point summary below of the events that I've covered over the past three months; ETH Denver Gearbox/Liquity/Euler Sponsored Event at Happy Camper Pizza ~250 attendees Received feedback that it was the \"best side event at ETH Denver from multiple attendees Teams from Variant, DefiLlama, Balancer, Aura, Alchemix, Chainlink, Redstone, and more came to discuss the space. Special shoutout to the VIBES Subcommittee for funding Gearboxs share of this co-hosted event and (also designing) the T-shirts that were printed. Met with RIAs, Asset Managers, Liquid Funds, and protocols/infrastructure teams at ETH Denver. Attended four other VC networking events and networked at the conference NFT NTC side events Did not pay for a ticket to NFT.NYC Met with some blue-chip NFT communities and discussed how they use defi (especially borrowing against their own NFTs or lending them out for APY), and educated them on how to use Gearbox Consensus Austin Next week, I've scheduled meetings with four wallet companies to continue the push to get Gearbox deposits represented in wallet native UIs, three funds to discuss LP'ing, and two protocols to discuss potential collaboration Additional Activity With the intention of starting to build out a more robust pipeline, I worked with Ilgiz to set up an AirTable CRM to start tracking conversations, as well as an inbound interest form that will live on multiple Gearbox sites so that potential users and collaborators can reach out directly to the business development email in case they do not feel comfortable jumping into a discord. I've also generated a new KOL revenue sharing link with a former sales colleague that operates out of the Asia/Pacific region, and I've started working with them on identifying new potential funds to meet regarding Gearbox. Finally, I've met with at least 12 external projects that have reached out to diligence if we can work together. This activity was discussed in the original forum post to see if it would fall under my \"jurisdiction, and although I'm not spending extra time looking forthese projects, I do feel that my knowledge of our system lends itself well to qualifying if an inbound lead would be worth pursuing and introducing across the DAO to members with specific areas of expertise. Areas to improve and next steps Increasing new TVL leads Going to Consensus will be another step to meeting new firms and finding new opportunities. Leaning in to EMEA and APAC opportunities, as those regions seem to be embracing DeFi more Still entertaining buying access to a \"funds list, but working with the network to see the best route for this Working with VIBES subdao to send messages directly to whale wallets Gearing up for V3 Educating previously engaged funds around the new V3 improvements will continue to be vitalAs V3 launches (hopefully in this engagement window) then the \"Make Your Own Leverage pools will be vital in attracting larger LPs that are more particular about the risk that they are exposed to. V3 will allow additional limits to be placed within the protocol, thus allowing launches to other chains. Being a point of contact, as well as starting to engage with these other platforms will be an important piece of my job, even if it is not my primary objective. Finding new teams to build on Gearbox, and exploring potential avenues to bootstrap liquidity across networks with partners.

Of course, the system itself works completely on-chain, contracts are immutable (although DAO can change various system parameters) However, a number of features require operational support: in particular, adding new pools, onboarding new assets, changing the parameters of current [Policies]([link]), etc. These tasks do not require the development of code from scratch, however, they are quite sensitive (as well as any on-chain changes) Accordingly, with the growth of the protocol, an additional level of operational complexity arises: the current team is busy with v3 (and will always be busy with new things), while it is necessary to correctly deploy the existing audited code and avoid stupid error.

The rewards will run until the end of the year unless replaced by a new tokenomics model. CONTEXT But we just changed this in GIP-49! (Context) Yes. Essentially in [[GIP-49]]([link]) We fked around and found out. ![image]([link]) Since GIP-49, the previous veCRV voters have left the pool, and altcoins have lost value vs ETH. It is a real possibility that if nothing changes GEAR/wETH liquidity could drop below $1m. This is equivalent to 4 months of diesel LM - ie, could create significant sell pressure. Additionally, $1m liquidity is somewhat of a mental barrier of \"legitimacy\" for liquidity. Increasing the rewards back to 6.66m GEAR/month can shore up the liquidity to weather further adverse conditions while still representing a minor net increase to liquidity mining emissions. For reference - diesel LM program is currently 23m gear/month. This proposal would represent a net 12% increase to the liquidity mining program across diesel pools and GEAR/wETH pools. Alternative Configurations There are two potential alternatives: Switching the rewards to veCRV or vlCVX bribes, or switching liquidity to a balancer boosted pool. Switching rewards to veCRV or vlCVX bribes would offer a slightly multiplier (historically around 1-1.5x) on efficiency, however it would mean farmers are receiving CRV and CVX, and voters recieve GEAR, thus making LPers unable to accumulate GEAR thru LM. This is a smaller form of fk around and find out, but ultimately only represents a marginal increase for once again potentially unknown downsides. Switching to a boosted pool could potentially achieve the same liquidity with 40% less emissions (slightly better outcome than the veCRV/vlCVX bribe multiplier) . However, this would require existing LPs to migrate to Balancer and accept the new APR, and also have confidence that nothing else will change in the near future. Usually getting new liquidity requires boosted APR for a period of time. Given there are ongoing discussions around potential locked liquidity 80/20 pools and other tokenomics, less change is better and liquidity providers will be far more likely to remain in the curve pool, and likely accept a slightly reduced APR, than they would be to migrate to a new pool with only a slightly higher APR. Therefore, once again the potential downside of fking around and finding out is not worthwhile.

Abstract: Aave has experienced instances of scammers and bad actors attempting to submit phishing proposals. These proposals have caused disruptions in Aaves off-chain governance and have resulted in a waste of time and resources. To prevent these incidents from happening again, we propose modifying the Snapshot proposal threshold to 250 AAVE. Motivation: We recommend that the community update the proposal threshold to a level that would deter scammers and bad actors. The new threshold would require proposals to meet certain minimum requirements, in this case holding or delegated 250 AAVE (or equivalent.) This level is 3.3X the previous proposal threshold as of 04/07/23. By updating this threshold, we can ensure that only legitimate proposals are considered and that the risk of scams, illegitimate, or fraudulent proposals is significantly reduced. Here is an example of recurring junk proposals: ![Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 4.12.43 [image]]([link]) By modifying the proposal threshold required to post a Snapshot, there are many benefits for Aaves off-chain Governance process. A few notable ones include: 1. Better quality proposals: By setting a higher threshold, we will receive proposals from more experienced and qualified professionals and delegates 2. Reduced risk of fraud: Increasing the proposal threshold will help to reduce the risk of scams and fraudulent proposals. 3. Improved efficiency: By setting a higher threshold, we will have fewer proposals to review, which will help us to be more efficient with our time and resources. Specification: To implement this proposal, an Aave Snapshot admin will need to update the spaces proposal threshold to 250 AAVE and communicate these new requirements. A list of existing admins with this ability: @monet-supply @marczeller [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] [hexadecimals] Next Steps Next steps to ensure a successful upgrade of Snapshots proposal threshold: 1.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary In order to support an OHM asset listing on Gearbox and to bootstrap the initial market, deploy a Gearbox Lending AMO. The initial capacity of this AMO is set at 100k OHM which will be deployed in tranches into the Gearbox passive OHM lending pool. As the market matures and third party capital flows into the lending market, the lending AMO capacity can be decreased over time to make room for third party depositors. (Parallel proposal for Gearbox can be found here: [link]) Gearbox background Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol. It has two sides: passive liquidity providers who earn yield by depositing assets single-sidedly, and active traders and farmers who borrow these assets for leveraged yield strategies. Borrowers on the platform open isolated credit accounts, which hold both the user funds and the borrowed funds. These funds are deployed into whitelisted integrations such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, Lido and Yearn. Today, Gearbox has around $90m in TVL and $56m in borrowed funds across the current pools (DAI, USDC, FRAX, WETH, WBTC, wstETH) The protocol has been live for over a year, has been audited multiple times, and has an ongoing bug bounty programme with Immunefi. The current protocol iteration (v2) has been audited by ChainSecurity, Consensys Diligence, and Sigma Prime. For more information on Gearbox please see here: [link] Motivation Following OIP-127, Olympus has made the first steps into OHM lending markets. Currently, a total of 73k OHM is deployed in lending markets through this programme (note that following the Euler exploit all these funds are in Silo) A key goal of the Lending AMO project has been to promote OHM as a borrowable asset. Listing OHM on Gearbox would offer users an alternative stable-ish asset to borrow instead of USD stables. The benefits of introducing OHM as a borrowable asset outlined in OIP-127 still hold true. But one additional strength of a Lending AMO is that they allow for rapid bootstrapping of new markets. And so to help support the listing of OHM as an asset on Gearbox and to guarantee a minimum amount of liquidity on the platform, this OIP approves the creation of a Lending AMO for Gearbox. Over time, as the market matures and as third party capital finds its way into the OHM passive lending pool, the protocol can scale back the deployment of this AMO to make more room for third parties. Since users deposit assets single-sidedly into the passive pools, the Gearbox OHM lending pool could create an opportunity for passive OHM holders to earn yield on their assets. Its worth noting as well that in contrast to more traditional lending markets, the Gearbox credit account style lending only works with whitelisted integrations. So there is no risk of OHM being borrowed and used for, for example, staking and OHM bonds, which could have a undesired effect due to rate arbing. As with the previous lending AMOs, any OHM minted but not borrowed will not increase the circulating supply. Only after a borrower deposits collateral and borrows OHM will this be considered part of the circulating OHM supply. Details - Deployment source: Gearbox OHM passive lending pool - Maximum capacity: 100k OHM, deployed in tranches - Method: Multisig deployment at first, to be switched over to a contract per OIP-130 (once available) Note: this proposal depends on an OHM listing on Gearbox. Should the Gearbox listing proposal fail to pass governance this OIP will not be executed.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about creating a Gearbox Lending AMO (Asset Management Organization) in order to support an OHM asset listing on Gearbox.

This can help promote OHM as a borrowable asset, create an opportunity for passive holders of OHM to earn yield on their assets, and ensure that any borrowed funds are used with whitelisted integrations only without risking inflation due to rate arbing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nIntroduction This snapshot temp check asks the AaveDAO to approve a bug bounty program hosted on Immunefi. Immunefi proposes to engage with community contributors, the Aave Companies and BGD Labs, who would support the bug bounty program as technical experts in terms of receiving and evaluating bug reports as well as providing their view on what should and shouldn't be covered under the program, pending DAO approval. Motivation Currently, the Aave Protocol boasts a TVL of over USD 5 billion. A key reason why the protocol has managed to amass such impressive liquidity is due to the DAOs security-focused culture. Users of the protocol feel safe when using Aave. As the Protocol continues to develop thanks to impressive work done by DAO contributors, with some notable innovations being V3 and GHO, it continues to be incredibly important that as much care is taken to ensure that users feel safe when using the protocol. One great way to further protect user funds is to enact an effective and standardized bug bounty program. A bug bounty program encourages security researchers to continuously look through our codebase and responsibly disclose any bugs that they find, especially as new types of vulnerabilities are being discovered. Additionally, it provides a last option for blackhat hackers who find a bug to disclose it instead of exploiting it and get rewarded with clean funds. About Immunefi Immunefi is the leading bug bounty and security services platform for Web3, featuring the worlds largest Web3 security community and bug bounty programs. Immunefi guards many billions in users' funds across projects like Wormhole, MakerDAO, Polygon, Chainlink, Lido, Stacks, Optimism, and many more. The company has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities that put tens of billions of dollars at risk across hundreds of projects. Implementation Immunefi proposes to work together with two other community contributors, Aave Companies and BGD Labs, in order to ensure that the bug bounty program is written and maintained to an optimal level, ranging from the assets that are covered by the program, SLAs with regards to response times, rewards for valid bug reports, as well as points of clarification within the program. The terms of implementation in this section is thus not set in stone but will be the starting point for the program. The assets considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program will be those that are identified as critical to the operation of the Protocol. However, in order to ensure maximum safety for Aave users, a bug report would be considered as in-scope regardless of the asset being listed or not as long as it is a Critical-level smart contract report with funds being directly at risk. All rewards for bug reports will utilize the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. If Immunefi develops a new classification system, the one implemented into the Aave bug bounty program may be changed to reflect these changes, and would request a review from both Aave Companies and BGD Labs. For the Aave bug bounty program, we will begin with covering Low to Critical vulnerabilities for smart contract assets. Additional severity levels will be considered shortly after its launch. The reward amounts will be as follows: Smart Contracts Critical - Up to USD 1 000 000 High - Up to USD 100 000 Medium - Up to USD 5 000 Low -Up to USD 1 000 Final amounts will be decided after the scoping stage. Critical smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% from the first attack, respectively. However, there will be a minimum reward such that the reward amount is above that of High in order to prevent hackers from sitting on a bug report while potential economic damage increases. Rewards over USD 150 000 will be paid out in batches of up to USD 150 000 until the full reward amount is paid out. The first batch will be paid out within the SLA period for resolving a bug report and the monthly payout starts in the succeeding calendar month if the first Monday falls 15 days after the first payout. High smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to a maximum hard cap of the maximum High reward. This is implemented in order to account for the increased relative impact based on the duration of the freezing of funds. There will be, however, a minimum reward for High smart contract vulnerabilities. In addition to the standard bug report information requested by Immunefi in its bug submission page, a runnable proof of concept (PoC) will be required for all smart contract bug reports. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. All bug report submitters must comply with the Immunefi rules. Employees and team members of the community contributor teams (including Aave Companies and BGD Labs in case the DAO supports that they are nominated to assist Immunefi), including those who held this status within 12 calendar months of a bug report date, are not eligible for any reward. Payments will be made in stablecoins that are held in the treasury as well as AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve. Immunefi Fee As its standard fee, Immunefi will charge the DAO a performance fee based on the reward paid out to the bug bounty hunter, charged on top of the reward. This standard fee is 10% Effectively this means that if a bug bounty hunter receives a reward of USD 1 000, Immunefi would be paid an additional fee of USD 100. Immunefi will charge no onboarding or maintenance fees for hosting and assisting with the bug bounty program. Any add-on services will be dealt separately, if ever additional services are desired in the future. Engagement with the DAO As part of the above-mentioned program, it is required that there are entities directly in contact with Immunefi who can work on behalf of the DAO to review submissions and engage with security researchers along with other tasks. Naturally, as part of the bug bounty program extremely sensitive information could be shared. If this program and our engagement with it is approved by the DAO, the responsibility of both companies will be the following: -Engage with Immunefi in defining and launching the bug bounty program. -Review all bug bounty submissions and assign a level of severity. -Respond and engage with the security researcher to resolve and patch any vulnerabilities, though it is understood that the security researchers responsibility ends at providing information about the bug and not providing work for fixing. -Any other stated responsibility as set out by the Immunefi statement of work. -Update the DAO on important information regarding the program. BGD Labs and Aave Companies in their capacity in supporting Immunefi would also seek to comply with the necessary SLAs wherever it is not restricted by governance systems within the Protocol, such as payments. This would be to ensure that security researchers can expect the same level of responsiveness that they do with other bug bounty programs on Immunefi. Conclusion This snapshot temp check proposes an Immunefi bug bounty program for the AaveDAO. The intention of this program is to properly incentivise white hats to test the security of the protocol and report recognised vulnerabilities. If approved, Aave Companies and BGD Labs would engage with Immunefi on behalf of the DAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about setting up a bug bounty program with Immunefi for the AaveDAO.

Context As a reminder, agEUR was initially deployed on BNB Chain, as[announced]([link])on October 21, 2022 on the protocols Twitter account. BNB Chain remains major Layer 1 with now more unique adresses than Ethereum. During the past few months, it has gained even more traction and importance with the deployment of both major and up-and-coming dApps such as Uniswap, Trader Joe and Radiant in March 2023, to only name a few. Given the great number of protocols deployed and number of users exceeding all other alternative chains, building agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain is an important step to the development of agEUR. In the current context, creating liquidity for agEUR is part of the path to reinstate and maintain agEUR as a leading Euro stablecoin onchain. The seeding of a agEUR-USDT 300k pool was previously[voted]([link])on February 28, 2023. As at this date, the protocol has 150,013.11 USDT and 140,995.13 agEUR tokens[available on BNB Chain]([link])that will be used for implementing this proposal, if voted. Information on the state of Angle of Protocol including the holdings of the DAO can be found[here]([link]) Considering that the protocol previously seeded a agEUR-USDT pool on Pancake Swap and that the seeded amount are still available on the guardian multisig on BNB Chain, this amount could be used to implement this proposal. Proposal The proposal to seed a total amount of $300k, using the agEUR and USDT token available[here]([link])on BNB Chain. The available USDT amounts to 150,013.11 USDT and the available agEUR amounts to 140,995.13 agEUR. In respect of agEUR, the pool will be seeded with $150k worth of each token. Considering that the Euro is currently higher than the dollar, it is suggested to burn the remaining agEUR. If the proposal is approved and in the event that Euro depreciates between now and the date of its implementation, it suggested that the protocol mints agEUR to match the 150k USDT if needed. Such agEUR would be minted through[Direct Deposit Modules]([link])these agEUR are still backed by the collateral that are used to issue them.

Value to the protocol Re-deploying a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap is intended to continue the development of agEUR on BNB Chain that was previously initiated and unleash a wide range of opportunities for agEUR in the BNB ecosystem allowing it to be more easily integrated with the protocols that are getting built there. Bootstrapping agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain through PancakeSwap is also an efficient choice for the protocol as PancakeSwap remains the most popular and most used DEX on BNB with roughly $100m to $400m+ daily volume. Risks This proposal bears a risk of bad debt also possible with the agEUR paired with USDT in the Direct Deposit Modules if any additional agEUR were to be minted, but given the size of the pool proposed, the need for agEUR liquidity and the surplus available to the protocol, this can reasonably be considered as acceptable.

Context Angle has setup [a bridge infrastructure]([link]) relying on LayerZero that allows anyone to bridge agEUR from any of Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC and Celo to any of the other chains. In some of these chains, the Borrowing module is also natively deployed. For agEUR to become a global standard used everywhere, agEUR integration efforts should be made across all blockchains, not only those where Angle is natively deployed. Proposal The proposal is to add support for Celo on Angle bridge infrastructure, which means that it'd be possible to bridge to Celo from any of the chains already supported and conversely. Implementation agEUR and LayerZero bridge contracts on Gnosis Chain have already been deployed (addresses can be found[here]([link])) Admin on each of these chains will be the same as on all other chains: there is one governor and one guardian multisig on each of the chains, with the same signers as their equivalent on mainnet.

Which currently has a configurator role - the only role that can make config changes in contracts. It leads to potential vulnerable cases because transactions approved by multi-sig are executed immediately. Another case is the user who disagrees with approved proposals has no time to react by withdrawing liquidity or making other financial decisions. To mitigate these potential vulnerabilities and to give all users time to react, we propose to change the proposal execution flow to add a Timelock contract with 1 day delay of execution after Gnosis transactions are executed.

Growing adoption and usage of Passport through development of on-chain mechanisms, user experience improvements, and broader DevRel initiatives. 2. Generating upside through strategic tests, including at least two revenue experiments, to identify sustainable value capture mechanisms that contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Gitcoin Passport App and the DAO. 3. Gathering a plurality of scoring mechanisms for communities to adopt, encouraging innovation from the broader community and making Passport a more versatile tool for managing identity and reputation. 4. Galvanizing community experiences around Passport by researching and potentially enabling custom community experiences, integration capabilities, and branded Passport experiences natively in their applications. Measurement Measuring progress against these goals will be critically important: Growing adoption 1. Increase the number of Passports by 5x (to 1MM) 2. Maintain an average stamp count of 8 or higher per passport. 3. Increase the number of integrators by 5x Generating upside 1. Test at least two experiments to generate upside 2. Generate at least $1 in revenue Gathering a plurality of Scoring Mechanisms 1. Ensure at least 5 scoring mechanisms available to communities 2. Ensure at least 4 of the scoring mechanisms are used Galvanize community experiences 1. Research and decide if we should build custom community experiences.

This being the case, we look to the GCP process as a mechanism to fund base operational governance, while leaving room for aspirational governance innovation via subsequent GPC proposals. Abstract: When compared to traditional business, governance is one of the key components that changes within the DAO. Broadly, the goal of optimized governance in a DAO is to reduce the friction within the DAO, increase productivity, and to capture the intent of the community in a way that multiplies the network effect with a view towards long term outcomes. To meet this need, this proposal is built in a way to minimally facilitate steward governance, get the greatest value out of our governing bodies, and to act as an impartial arbiter of the governance process. Additionally, this GCP would be staffed in a way to quickly adapt to critical governance outages and some operational improvements. This is an experiment and we know there are risks associated with using a temporary funding mechanism like the GCP for operational work. An outcome of this experiment will be a recommendation on if GCPs are appropriate for this kind of work or if the DAO should find another way to staff the work. Vote: For - Fund Gitcoin Governance $20800 for Season 18 For - Fund Gitcoin Governance $41600 for Season 18 & 19 Against - Do not fund Gitcoin Governance for Season 18 or 19 Abstain Details of this proposal can be found in the link below.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about using the Gitcoin Governance Process (GCP) to fund operational governance work, such as reducing friction within the DAO and capturing the intent of the community.

We are proposing allocating up to 100,000 OP as part of the current AGD proposal and keeping the remaining 200,000 OP in the AGD multisig for future seasons of AGD. Background Last year, [we created a proposal and successfully received 300,000 OP tokens]([link]) as part of phase 0 of OP Stimpack. The tokens are to go towards funding projects to help grow Aave on Optimism. The original post in the Optimism forum states: ![Aave [image]]([link]) AGD has funded multiple projects building on Optimism with funds received from Aave DAO. These include: Analytics from[DappLooker]([link]),[Block Analitica]([link]) &[Projection Finance]([link]) Integrations with[Mean Finance]([link]),[Layer3]([link]) &[DeFunds]([link]) Native apps like[Pegasus Finance]([link]),[Lyra Finance]([link]) &[Cetra Finance]([link]) This proposal seeks to clarify and gain community support as to how the OP received should be allocated. Proposed Allocation The proposal recommends allocating up to 100k OP to be used in the same timeline as [the current AGD engagement]([link]) and keeping the remaining 200k OP in the AGD multisig for use in future quarters of AGD. We are thankful to Optimism for receiving these funds. We want to exercise diligence in allocating them and believe that at current market prices, the original amount received can support several quarters of AGD. Separating these amounts will ensure long-term support for teams building in the Aave Optimism ecosystem. For the 100k OP to distribute under the current AGD engagement, we propose a breakdown of funds similar to what was outlined in the original post on the Optimism forum: 2/3rds to grants and 1/3rd to events. 1. Optimism focused grants: up to 2/3rds For the grants portion, the OP will be distributed to grant recipients focused on growing Aave on Optimism. Going forward, and aligned with our current proposal, we will place a larger focus on funding projects related to growing GHO on Optimism. To help attract builders and grow awareness, we will push a wider marketing effort about the campaign. 2. Optimism focused events & bounties: up to 1/3rd The main area this will go to is sponsoring bounties and prizes at hackathons for teams building to support or grow the Aave Optimism ecosystem. These bounties will be in addition to the bounties AGD is already planning to offer at hackathons. Since AGD is already sponsoring these events, all of the sponsorship fees and other overhead costs that would be required are already covered, making this an effective way to put the OP to use. Any unused funds will remain in the treasury and can be allocated in future AGD proposals. Updates on OP spent will be included periodically in[AGDs monthly forum updates]([link]) Next Steps Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal. Snapshot: If positive, AGD will proceed with the allocation of funds as described above. No AIP or further governance action is required.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is asking the Aave Grants DAO (AGD) community to approve how to allocate 300,000 OP tokens that were received as part of the OP Stimpack phase 0.

Moving forward, we look to the GCP process as a mechanism to fund operational & organizational efficiency within one of our primary community & working hubs: Discord. Scope: I propose funding Discord management to do five things: Continue addressing daily server management tasks and contributor requests. a) Respond to DAO contributor access, channel/role creation, and help/informational requests within 24 hours. b) Tracking of server insights and metrics to spot suspicious activity c) Regular checking of role access to various channels and the ongoing need for these roles d) Regular checking of activity across channels to ensure stale channels are archived when they become stale e) Continued maintenance and monitoring of bots for active use, relevant updates, server security/automation, and community engagement Facilitate coordination and strategy between workstreams, working groups, and community groups within Discord. a) Suggest proper & scalable approaches toward implementing new working groups or growing existing ones b) Creation & maintenance of admin-level roles for individual workstream, guild, and pod maintenance Continue documenting best practices and how-to guides for contributors. a) These are developed as needed. Examples include a Discord best practices guide, a kick/ban policy, a bot access tracker, a guide to playing music in Discord, and Discord channel structure/role access documentation Continue the development, maintenance, and user training of the Gitcoin Sentry bot as an in-house security tool. a) The Gitcoin Sentry bot is an internally-developed bot that provides access to mass-moderation commands and unique server security functionalities, such as targeted pruning and public-channel monitoring, not offered by other bots. In addition to the continued development of this bot, a series of documentation providing usage guidance will be developed and shared with DAO Core members and any other contributor with administrative-level access on any level within the server Coordinate the development of a ChatGPT response bot a) We will aim to introduce a ChatGPT-powered bot to quickly respond to community questions with answers from our Knowledge Base and assist with wayfinding within the server and broader Gitcoin Community. This bot will improve citizen comfort and engagement while reducing the contributor strain of additionally monitoring the active public channels to assist grantees and other citizens experiencing issues or that have questions Benefits: Retain high context tooling contributor who understands the DAO, its organizational structure, and the needs across workstreams/working groups Maintenance of a healthy, safe, and efficient working space Quickly respond to emergent contributor requests and potential scams/raids Continued development of bots to improve security, contributor productivity, and community support/engagement Risk assessment: Using the GCPs process to fund high-context work could lead to a loss of resources due to the seasonal instability of the role Not funding this work will mean the existing work must be stopped or reassigned to existing resources Budget: An estimate based on the history of filling this role suggests this work requires one contributor operating at a part-time capacity, or approximately 30 hours per week for the 13 week season. Payments would be distributed by one Tally vote for the season or by individual Tally votes at the end of each month. This role will require access to \"core contributor tools such as Discord (with \"moderator access), email, g-suite, miro, etc. There is no consideration for vacation, travel, training, severance, conferences, or other ancillary DAO/workstream contributor benefits. 30 hours/week 13 weeks = 390 hours total. 390 hours at $60 per hour = $23,400 Total request: $23,400 All spending will be tracked, including hours committed. Any unused funds will be sent back to the treasury at the end of the season if a consecutive GCP is not passed. Timeline: The season would start on May 1 and conclude on July 31, for a total of 13 weeks. There would be no severance should the service not be renewed.
