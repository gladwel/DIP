4,Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves,"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves. status: Proposal. author: 3SE Holdings. Simple Summary. This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmonys Horizon Bridge. This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts. Motivation. The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1. This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop. Specification. If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.","The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO.

18,KlimaDAO x Sushi Carbon Offset Integration [Signal],"This proposals expectation is to produce a community signal. Full details and discussions thus far can be found at: [link] Synopsis: KlimaDAOs goal is to embed the cost of carbon emissions into our economic system through the creation and governance of a carbon-backed currency, aligning incentives between investors, civil society, and organization. KlimaDAO also chose Sushi as the primary place for supplying liquidity for these carbon-based credits making Sushi a critical part of the on-chain carbon market. Liquidity was the first step in revolutionizing the current Voluntary Carbon Market. Since then, KlimaDAO has launched tooling that allows anyone to offset their carbon emissions, unlocking the ability for any individual or entity to play a part in the future of the carbon market. Decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols are the most commonly used application in DeFi and amongst the largest consumers of gas on the blockchain. This makes DEXs a critical point of leverage for combatting carbon emissions on the blockchain. With this, KlimaDAO is proposing the implementation/creation of an opt-in feature where users can elect to and automate the offsetting of their swaps directly through Sushi. Initial signal is to explore adding an optional toggle, like the ""expert mode toggle, that simply enables or disable carbon offsetting for swaps. KlimaDAO is offering to put in the research/development resources in order to produce an implementation for this proposal and will work with the Sushi dev team to make sure the implementation works and is properly integrated. TLDR: Give KlimaDAO the wei to build out an opt-in toggle feature to enable Sushis users to offset their carbon emissions.",KlimaDAO wants to partner with Sushi Swap to offset the carbon emissions from each transaction on the Polygon decentralized exchange. This would allow users to offset their emissions with a one-click solution.,KlimaDAO wants to partner with Sushi Swap to offset the carbon emissions from each transaction on the Polygon decentralized exchange.

25,Should Uniswap provide Rage Trade with an additional use grant?,"Authors: [Noodles]([link]) + [Crema]([link]) + [Vertex]([link]) Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant]([link]) What is Rage Trade? [Rage Trade]([link]) is a new perpetual swap protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp. Why do we need an additional use grant? Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswaps core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. What changes have we made that require additional use? We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswaps BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for): - [SimulateSwap]([link]): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswaps TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries. - [TickBitmapExtended]([link]): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswaps TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract. - [TickExtended]([link]): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3. - [LiquidityPosition]([link]): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic) It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so. How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap? 1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3. 2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curves tricrypto. 3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. Conclusion. Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswaps value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.","Rage Trade is a new way to do swaps using Uniswap v3. We need an additional use grant because we have built libraries that enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates.

Approving this proposal will benefit Uniswap because it will add new liquidity and TVL, and we will spend resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategies.","The proposal is for an additional use grant for the Rage Trade protocol. The protocol is built on top of Uniswap v3 and adds new features for traders, such as leverage trading and real-time funding rates. The grant would be used to cover the costs of developing the necessary libraries to enable these features.","The authors have developed a new trading protocol called Rage Trade, built on top of Uniswap v3, which is designed to be more efficient for traders and liquidity providers. Rather than creating a fully independent system, they've added new features to the existing Uniswap framework, like leverage trading and real-time funding rates. This requires an additional use grant, similar to a previous proposal by Voltz Protocol. They believe their changes will bring new liquidity to Uniswap v3 and allow for new trading strategies. They are seeking approval and feedback from the Uniswap community.","Rage Trade is a new perpetual swap protocol that uses Uniswap v3. Unlike other on-chain perpetuals, Rage Trade is built on top of Uniswap v3 instead of forking its code.

The proposal seeks an additional use grant to support the development of these features, which include libraries for simulating swaps, using tick data, enabling real-time funding payments, and facilitating leverage liquidity providing. Approving this proposal would benefit Uniswap by bringing new liquidity to UNI v3, investing in LP strategies, and enabling new spot strategies that mitigate impermanent loss and offer unique payoffs.","This passage is explaining why the Rage Trade protocol needs an additional grant from Uniswap. The proposal outlines the specific libraries that they have built on top of Uniswap v3s code and how approving this grant would benefit Uniswap by bringing in new liquidity, spending resources on designing efficient LP strategies, and enabling spot strategies that are currently not possible on the spot market.","Rage Trade is a new perpetual swap protocol built using Uniswap v3.

26,[Consensus Check] - Enable 1bp Fee Tier on UniswapV3 Optimism(L2),"Summary: Enable a 1bp, 1tick fee tier on optimism (L2) The rationale and initial temperature check for this proposal can be found here: [link] Process: The complete process is described in Uniswaps Governance Reference here 4 and can be summarized as:  A proposal is posted in GovernorBravo on Mainnet (GovernorAlpha for Kovan)  The proposal is voted, queued and executed via Timelock.  When all the conditions are meet and is executed, Timelock contract, which is authorized to execute administrative actions on the protected contracts, will execute. the requested actions in the proposal. Since this proposal needs to be executed on a different network, in this case L2 Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. In order to do that, Timelock will send the transaction to OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2) The transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswaps CrossChainAccount, that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to UniswapV3Factory. The sequence of contract interactions is the following:  GovernorBravo.propose(targets, values, signatures, calldatas, description)  where targets are the address of the contracts to interact with,  calldatas the calldatas to execute on those contracts, and.  description, the description of the proposal (or name)  OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(target, calldata, gas)  where target is the address of the contracts to interact with on L2,  calldata the calldata to execute on that contract, and.  gas, the gas to be used on that transaction.

This is a proposal to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022 in accordance with rule 3.1 of the working group rules passed under [EP 4]([link]) If this proposal is passed, the Community Working Group will be dissolved at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, leaving three remaining working groups within the ENS DAO: 1. Meta-Governance Working Group; 2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group; and. 3. Public Goods Working Group. On the basis that new working groups cannot be formed within the DAO unless it can shown that "" the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group (rule 2.2), the same standard should apply for the dissolution of working groups. After consulting with Stewards and Community Working Group participants, regarding their work and experiences during the First Term of 2022, it is clear that: 1. each subgroup within the Community Working Group could comfortably fall within the Ecosystem Working Group; and. 2. the DAO does not have enough active participants to justify having ""community"" as a standalone working group.

66,[Temperature Check] Create the Uniswap Foundation,"[Read the full proposal here: [link]] Uniswap Foundation: Preamble. Uniswap has already changed the world. In only 3 years, the worlds first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than $1T 7 in cumulative volume, and served millions of users 4 worldwide. Its daily volume today is on par with Coinbase 10. Ownership of the protocol was transferred to the community 12 in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 22 improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling. However, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects. We want to change that. Today, we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community. In other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support you. Uniswaps community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more. The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future. It will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem. It will help you make an impact  to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts. We believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet. It brought the automated market maker to the masses. It has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3. It is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure  constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our worlds financial infrastructure. But there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential. We're excited to work with all of you to make that happen. If you're excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - @devinawalsh and @nkennethk are open), and spread the word. Uniswap Foundation Proposal. This proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal. TL;DR. Today, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation (UF) Scope: The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocols decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate. Team: Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12. Budget: To fund these efforts, we are requesting: A $14M Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years. A $60M expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years. We are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of $20M. Governance Participation: We are also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser 40, this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance. Uniswap Foundation. Mission. In pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem. Key Activities and OKRs. We have listed our starting OKRs below. Its possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community. Growth: Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Governance: Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Advocacy: Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Optimism Phase 0 token distribution link here 6. Year 1 Roadmap. Our roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities: ![Year [image]]([link]) Optimism Collective community Constitution link here. Team. Devin Walsh 108, Executive Director (ED) As ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UFs strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision. Devin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MITs Digital Currency Initiative, worked on decentralized identity at uPort (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at CoinFund. She has consulted with Edge & Node and cLabs, and led MIRA, a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF. Ken Ng 69, Head of Operations. As Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UFs impact. Ken has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the Uniswap Grants Program 1 for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program, which gave Hayden his initial grant 7 to build Uniswap. He served as COO of Slingshot Finance and cofounder of his nonprofit eduDAO, which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx. The needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first: ![[image]]([link]) Applications are open today! Check out job descriptions here. As noted by Other Internet 4, there is also a need for new structures to ""facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives. Advisors. The Foundations initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals: Jesse Walden, Founder and GP, Variant. Julia Rosenberg, Co-Founder, Orca Protocol. Alexis Gauba, Co-Founder, Opyn; Co-Founder, she256. Hart Lambur, Co-Founder of UMA. In addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations, Provide input on UFs initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members. Become temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired. Board. Devin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UFs Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations. Budget. We are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets: $60M for Uniswap Grants Program. Grants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful. We are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this retrospective 22), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work. ![[image]]([link]) We are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are: A version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet. A prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space. We are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons. To ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M. We believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining. $14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years. In order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below) Budget estimate looking forward three years is below. ![[image]]([link]) Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year. The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation. Fund Disbursements. An approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested. We are requesting the funds in two disbursements: $20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $7.04, this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI. $54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement. To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $7.04 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/3/2022. Governance Participation. The UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance. These tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals. The Franchiser was developed by Noah Zinsmeister and was audited by Trail of Bits. Next Steps. We are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check. Additionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Mon., August 15.

Ownership of the protocol was transferred to the community 12 in 2020. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 22 improving governance, and developing new interfaces. The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future. It will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury. Uniswap has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3. It is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure. We believe it should define our worlds financial infrastructure. We're excited to work with all of you to make that happen. The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will be the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process. The UF will support the Protocols decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate. We are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements. The Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the UnisWap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem. We have listed our starting OKRs below.

We are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work. Grants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful. Budget estimate looking forward three years is below. $14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages. An approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested. We are requesting the funds in two disbursements: $20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. $54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months. The UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance. These tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation.

69,[ARC] Add MaticX to Polygon v3 Market,"Summary. Stader proposes addition of MaticX as collateral to Aave v3 Polygon market. Heres why Matic X will be a strong addition to the Aave v3 Polygon market: About Staderlabs. MaticX is built by Staderlabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~900mn $ in assets with 40k+ users staking with us across Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera. About MaticX. a. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents the users staked assets and accrued rewards. Matic X increases in value relative to Matic as staking rewards accrue. b. MaticX has been audited by top security audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Liquidity for MaticX. a. MaticX has high liquidity on Polygon, with ~3.7 mn$ of liquidity for our Matic <> MaticX pool on Quickswap, within days of LP launch. LPs on more DEXs coming in the next couple of weeks. Benefits to AAVE and Polygon. a. With MaticX, Matic holders can participate in both staking and Defi, unlocking new liquidity from staking for Defi, including Aave. b. Matic holders will be able to promote decentralization of Polygon by staking with multiple high performing validators. c. We expect staking participation of the community to increase as we launch a solution to stake directly on the Polygon mainnet in the coming fortnight. Proposed parameters for MaticX. a. Max LTV has 55% b. Liquidation threshold of 60-65% c. Liquidation penalty of 10-15% Background about Stader. StaderLabs 2 is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera. Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 900 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform. ~$850 M+ Luna staked. $65 M+ HBAR staked. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts. Adding MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon market. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents a users share of the staked Matic assets with Stader. It is a token that increases in price as the staked MATIC accrues staking rewards and these rewards are compounded i.e. MaticX simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC. Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard users funds. MaticX contracts have been audited twice by reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Here are the links to the two Audit Reports: Report 1 & Report 2. You can explore Staders Liquid Staking for Polygon by going over to the Stader Dapp: [link] 1. MaticX is available on Polygonscan at the address: '[hexadecimals]' MaticX Liquidity Pools. The MaticX <> Matic LP is live on Quickswap. LP size ~3.7 Mn USD (within a few days) Expect to significantly increase with dual rewards available for the pool. We are launching staking on the Polygon Mainnet in a few days and this will amplify the MaticX TVL and the LP size manifold (Polygons staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supports staking Matic on Ethereum.) We will also be creating LPs, and incentivising them across other Polygon DEXs. Benefits to Polygon & Aave Community. We believe MaticX will be a great addition to Aave v3 Polygon markets as it will unlock several borrowing use cases including leveraged staking, borrowing other assets with MaticX and potentially several DeGen strategies. Staders selection of validators is transparent (here 2) and centered around generating highest staking returns for delegators and encouraging decentralization of Polygon. High performing validators (100% of last 200 checkpoints, >98% checkpoints in last 90 days) Commissions (<=5%) Preference to lower voting power. We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon) Aave would be one of the first protocols to offer significant lending offerings for MaticX driving a lot of Matic community to Aave. Parameters. Based on the updated WMATIC risk parameters, we propose the following risk parameters for MaticX as MaticX is backed by Matic staked via Staders contract. Max LTV of 55% for MaticX (compared to 65% for WMATIC) Liquidation threshold of 60-65% for MaticX (compared to 70% for WMATIC) Liquidation penalty of 10-15% for MaticX (compared to 10% for WMATIC) We would like to hear feedback and update any specific information/ parameters as suggested by the Polygon and Aave community. Update (July 1, 2022) Adding a small section to update on all the developments from the time of original proposal being published. Traction: More than 13 million Matic by 1.4k+ unique wallets already staked with Stader for MaticX. We launched the ability for Polygon community to stake directly on Polygon in early May without having to bridge to Ethereum enabling cheaper, faster transactions and have seen strong adoption. Liquidity: We have ~10 mn $ in liquidity across DEXs, with a ~5.4 mn $ on Balancer metastable pool (suited for low slippage) On Polygon, currently in Top 2 pools by liquidity size on Balancer Polygon. Chainlink price feed: Our calculated price feed for MaticX from Chainlink is in testing phase and expected to be live in the week starting July 11. Defi and Lending: On lending, we have ~1 mn $ of MaticX already being lent on Polygon Defi (primarily on Meshswap single sided lending) We have also forged strong partnerships across Polygon Defi, including. a) Balancer Labs, Quickswap, Meshswap in DEXs, b) Beefy Finance, Autofarm, Harvest Finance in yield optimizers, Meshswap and. c) Meshswap, Market XYZ in lending. MaticX can be redeemed for the underlying Matic with an unbonding period of ~3 days (80 checkpoints as per Polygon native staking contract) mitigating depeg risks. Look forward to bringing MaticX to the AAVE and Polygon communities. Note: Staders overall now stands around 50 mn $ compared to the 900 mn $ at the time of original proposal due to the unfortunate Terra crash, where a large % of our TVL was. Risk Assessment. [Risk Assessment]([link]) details can be found on the Governance Forum. [image] [image] As with stETH and sAVAX, this proposal recommends listing maticX with borrowing disabled. Comments. Having recently obtained a Chainlink oracle, maticX can be listed on Aave v3 on Polygon. maticX can be added as collateral in Isolation Mode with a Supply Cap in place. A Supply Cap of around $6M is suggested which represents half the market capitalisation of maticX on Polygon and also approximately the value of a trade with 5% price impact via 1inchs aggregator at the time of writing. The Supply Cap should be revised to prevailing liquidity conditions. The initial listing risks parameters for maticX are the same as those proposed for stMATIC with a revised lower supply cap reflecting the lower liquidity profile. Given users may recursively strategy of depositing maticX, borrowing matic, swapping/staking it for maticX and then depositing maticX into Aaves lending pool again, an E-Mode should be created between maticX and MATIC. The Supply Cap is intended to ensure there sufficient maticX liquidity remains across decentralised exchanges, as the strategy has the effect of transferring liquidity from exchange liquidity pools into lending pools. With a calculated oracle, the risk of being liquidated is lower and therefore it is expected the leverage strategies will be more aggressively pursued than the stETH strategy on Aave v2 on Ethereum. The following Isolation and Efficiency Mode parameters would be a good starting place based upon current market conditions: Isolation & Efficiency-Mode Parameters.

73,[ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market,"Title: [ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market. author: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz. created: 20-08-2022. Simple Summary. In response to Tribe DAOs proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Abstract. Tribe DAO is dissolving the DAOs assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI. As FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEIs circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market. In response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO. This proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn. Motivation. With the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state. The details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here]([link]) As FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets. Specification. The recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Risk Parameters: Freeze the FEI market which will: Borrowing Enabled  Disable. Lending Enabled  Disable. Also, Reserve Factor 20%  100% Next Steps. The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the earliest 24th August 2022, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date 29th August 2022.

Also, 100% of the interest paid by borrowers will go to the Reserve Factor.","This proposal is about how the Ethereum Aave v2 market should respond to the Tribe DAO's decision to dissolve their assets and governance token (TRIBE), which means that their stablecoin, FEI, will eventually be swapped for an equal value of DAI. This will gradually reduce circulating FEI supply and liquidity, making it inefficient for liquidations and risky to the Ethereum Aave v2 market. To deal with this, the proposal suggests suspending both deposits and borrowing of FEI and directing all interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. There's a separate suggestion to encourage all holders of aFEI to swap it for FEI and then DAI. After a discussion period of at least 5 days, they aim to hold a community vote on this matter by August 24th, 2022. If the majority is in favor, they plan to implement changes by August 29th, 2022.

74,[ARC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor - aFEI Holding Update ,"Title: [ARC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor - aFEI Holding Update. Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham. Created: 21-08-2022. Simple Summary. In response to Tribe DAOs proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. Abstract. The Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin. If other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority. After redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee. Motivation. The FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35]([link]) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only [9,033,330.80]([link]) units of FEI held within the lending market. Fei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35]([link]) > available liquidity [9,033,330.80]([link]) This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders. The market currently supports [11,308,536.17]([link]) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80]([link]) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80]([link]) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish. Aave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans. This proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events. Once the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community]([link]) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here]([link]) In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds. Specification. The below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed. All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI. All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM. If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Next Steps. The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the earliest 25th August 2022, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date 29th August 2022.

98,[ARC] Change Admin role of Optimism and Arbitrum V3 markets,"Title: [ARC] Change Admin role of Optimism and Arbitrum V3 markets. Simple Summary: Aave V3 Arbitrum & Optimism markets are currently governed by the Community Guardian, a 6/10 elected multisig of 10 Aave community members with the responsibility to enforce community decisions on snapshot on-chain. This ARC intends to replace the community guardian in favor of Aave governance contracts for the administration of Arbitrum & Optimism V3 markets. Motivation: As cross-chain governance bridges received recent audits and in favor of more decentralization of Aave, this AIP intends to fade the community guardian role in Arbitrum and Optimism V3 markets in favor of Aave governance contracts. This means that if this AIP is validated by Aave governance, every AIP concerning the Arbitrum and OP markets will require an On-chain AIP vote to directly modify the Aave V3 markets on these networks for example onboard a new asset or change an asset risk parameters. The community guardian multisig always has been presented as a temporary solution in the wait of a cross-chain messaging solution allowing the Aave governance contracts to enforce directly onchain with no trusted intermediary for the governance decisions. Fading the guardian role is a step forward in Aave protocol decentralization. if this AIP gathers governance approval, the community guardian will keep an ""emergency failsafe role with the ability to freeze markets or cancel AIPs votes to protect the Aave markets in case of crisis or malicious AIPs. The cross-chain governance bridge contract that allows more decentralization of the Aave protocol has been audited by ChainSecurity and Certora, and a report of the audit of this contract can be found in the technical link section of this AIP. Technical specifications: The cross-chain governance bridges is a set of smart contracts that serve as an extension of the Ethereum Aave Governance, receiving the approved actions by the community in Ethereum, and executing them in the target chain. The details of the actions are described in a message which is passed from the L1 Aave Governance Executor contract using the native messaging mechanism of the chain: For Arbitrum, via creation of a retrayable ticket in the Arbitrum Inbox contract on Ethereum. For Optimism, via sending a message using the OVM L1 Cross Domain Messenger contract on Ethereum. The recipient of the bridged actions are the governance bridge contracts. Once actions reach these contracts, they are registered in the execution queue so they can be executed after a delay period. Queued actions are susceptible to being canceled for a period of time (e.g. grace period) by the Guardian. This is an ""emergency failsafe, a mechanism to protect the market in the target chain in case there is malicious or illegitimate action.

114,[BIP-85] Redeem TRIBE,"--- title: [BIP-85] Redeem TRIBE. status: Proposed. author: @llama - @Matthew_Graham. created: 03-10-2022. --- Summary. In response to recent events at Tribe DAO, this proposal presents the Balancer community the opportunity to redeem its TRIBE holding for a combination of stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI after conditions of the pending veBAL transaction vote are met, [5] Upon receipt the LQTY, FOX and DAI is to be converted to USDC. Abstract. With Fei Lab announcing a 5th October voting date for the Tribe DAO veBAL holding sale and a positive voting outcome expected, Llama proposes Balancer DAO redeems the TRIBE holding for an estimated $640.5K after 1M DAI from the FEI Peg Stability Module (PSM) has been made available to the TRIBE Redeemer contract. Balancer DAO holds 2.8M units of TRIBE in the Treasury which can be redeemed for 308.04 stETH, 6,729.56 LQTY, 993,593.68 FOX and 189,047.55 DAI worth an estimated $634,366.29 at spot prices, [1, 2] After a successful vote and token swap between Tribe DAO and Aave Companies, Balancer DAOs TRIBE holding will receive an additional 6,113 units of DAI when redeemed. This is based upon the 21.80 units of DAI per 10,000 units of TRIBE exchange rate mentioned by Fei Labs on Tribe DAOs governance forum, [1] As Balancers Snapshot will start after Tribe DAO Tally vote, Balancer DAO will be positioned to redeem TRIBE soon after the veBAL transaction is complete. Do note, Lama is in direct contact with Fei labs, Tribe DAO and Aave Companies and will be able to provide updates as and when needed. If the vote is to not pass in favour, then no action is to be taken. Motivation. With Tribe DAOs TIP-121 vote passing, the protocol has entered a terminal state as outlined below, [3]: FEI becomes wrapped DAI, redeemable 1:1 and fully backed specifically by DAI TRIBE becomes redeemable for a pro-rata claim on each remaining asset after setting aside DAI backing for FEI. Notably this excludes all TRIBE in the Tibre DAO Treasury. As Balancer DAO has already dissolved its FEI holding, only the remaining TRIBE holding needs to be redeemed for the underlying assets held within the PCV. The redeem contract for TRIBE token holders was deployed on the 25th September 2022. TRIBE can now be redeemed for stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI, [4] When Aave Companies has escrowed their 1M DAI, Tribe DAO will transfer 1M DAI from the FEI PSM to the TRIBE Redeem contract allowing TRIBE holders to access the 1M DAI immediately. Once this has occurred, Llama recommends Balancer DAO redeems the full TRIBE holding. The difference between Balance DAO redeeming now or after the additional 1M DAI deposit into the TRIBE Redeem contract is an estimated 6,104 DAI. Once the LQTY, FOX and DAI assets are received, they are to be transferred to the Liquidity Mining Multisig where they will be converted to USDC then transferred back to the main treasury wallet. The DAI is to be converted to USDC via Maker DAOs USDC PSM and the other assets swapped. Further details can be found on Tribe DAO governance forum. > [link] > [link] Specification.

If the vote does not pass successfully, there will be no action required. The assets received (LQTY, FOX and DAI) will then be changed into USDC and sent back to the main wallet.

The purpose of this AIP is to list BiLira (TRYB), the only and 1:1 Turkish Lira-backed stablecoin, on AAVE V3, Avalanche Network, Isolation Mode. References: Link to: [Project]([link]) [Whitepaper]([link])pdf) Token Contracts: [Ethereum]([link])[Avalanche]([link])[Polygon]([link])[Solana]([link])[BNB]([link]) [Dune Analytics Dashboard]([link]) Paragraph Summary: The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is available on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of open internet has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely and effortlessly share value and this created a need for non-USD stablecoins. We want to add TRYB to AAVE V3. Motivation: BiLira offers every Turkish citizen a seamless connection to the decentralized internet. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of the open internet - a fundamental network of information that is free and accessible to everyone regardless of financial motives - has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely, and effortlessly share information. The contributions to this advancement are immense and its impact is still unraveling around the world. Today, crypto assets and blockchain technology provide the means to transfer assets globally, securely, and at a low cost. Establishing an open internet based on value exchange can pave the way for a seamless, borderless and integrated world, which can eliminate barriers that enable the development of a global marketplace that is both economical and inclusive of everyone. Specifications: 1.What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? BiLira Team is the author of the AIP and the Asset. 2.Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. BiLira goes through regular audits performed by independent 3rd parties which can be found [here]([link]) BiLira (TRYB) TRYB is a Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. BiLira aims to bridge the gap between web 2.0 (monetized by fiat) and web 3.0 (fueled by crypto assets), to offer a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. The legacy financial system is dependent on private organizations and third-party services which makes it challenging for individuals to connect to the open internet and transact with one another. The current infrastructure does not support a transition from Web 2.0 banking system to the Web 3.0 crypto-based native web currencies. Since mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile, the public is looking for a better way that is more stable and safe to interact with digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Just as information flows freely between web browsers, BiLira aims to make transferring value between wallets effortless, instant, and borderless for everyone. 3.Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? TRYB (BiLira) is a great fit both as a borrow and collateral asset for the Aave ecosystem. AAVE will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community by listing the reliable and only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin, TRYB (BiLira) Turkey was the worlds fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. By enabling this user base to be able to use their currency as collateral, Aave will welcome a lot of new users to enter into DeFi. There are also multiple institutional and retail players that want to borrow TRYB to market make in Turkish Lira denominated crypto markets. 4.Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?) products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The stablecoin TRYB(BiLira) was released in early 2020. As it is a 1:1 fiat backed stablecoin doesn't have any pegging issues due to its nature. 5.How is the asset currently used? Advanced fiat on/off-ramp: BiLira offers a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high price volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. BiLira builds a fiat <> crypto on/off ramp for users to interact with global exchanges and DEXs as it is the only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. Global coverage: It will allow Turkish Users to participate on Aave with only a domestic bank transfer. Aave will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community. Turkey was the worlds fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. Turkey topped a million trades a day by the end of 2021. With over 40 exchanges operating in Turkey, the Middle Easts largest economy and home to around 85mn people, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is ever expanding. Turkish residents using cryptocurrencies were recorded at 16% to 20% between 2020 and 2022. Latest surveys show there are over 5 to 6 million Turkish people with cryptocurrency accounts. A cryptocurrency exchange in the country reported nearly 5 million users and had a trading volume of $203.5 million. Towards Decentralization: Turkish crypto users generally start their crypto journey through the local exchanges because they do not have to deal with the complexities of the blockchain technicalities, such as use of wallets and addresses. The BiLira team believes in the future of the Web3 decentralized ecosystem, where users control their assets via their own wallets, removing intermediaries and interacting with DeFi. 6.Emission schedule. BiLira is always fully collateralized and backed 1:1 by TRY fiat reserves. 7.Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY) There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB. -MasterMinter - adds and removes minters and increases their minting allowance (2 out of 3) -Minters - create and destroy tokens (2 out of 3) -Pauser - pause the contract, which prevents all transfers, minting, and burning (2 out of 3) -Blacklister - prevent all transfers to or from a particular address, and prevents that address from minting or burning (2 out of 3) -Owner - re-assign any of the roles except for admin (2 out of 3) -Admin - upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself (2 out of 3) The signers of the Multisig are the cofounders of the BiLira Company. 8.Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity) Daily trading volume, market capitalization, and other relevant analytics. -Total Issuance: 3,782,105,670 TRY. -Total Redemption: 3,642,521,623 TRY. -TRYB AUM: 139,584,047 TRY. -Fiat Reserves: 139,584,047 TRY. -Total on-chain transfer volume: 30,002,670,196 TRYB. -Listed on FTX, MEXC, Bitget, Bittrex, Liquid, Pangolin and DFX. -Oracle data for TRYB is available on Chainlink. 9.Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github) [Twitter]([link]) [Telegram]([link]) [LinkedIn]([link]) [Youtube]([link]) [Instagram]([link]) [News: Crunchbase]([link]) [News: Cointelegraph]([link]) [Conferences: Converge22]([link]) The total size of the media community is over 50,000+ users across all social media platforms.

Besides possible smart-contract risks,TRYB stablecoins are backed by fiat TRY and therefore, are the subject to fiat currency risk. Risk Analysis. -There is no regulation on stablecoins in Turkey. BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey. Users need to go through the KYC and AML process. -There haven't been any hacks or vulnerabilities on the project. -The contract is verified on the explorers mentioned above in market statistics. -The project can't be considered a security as TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY) There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB.

The current infrastructure does not support a transition from Web 2.0 banking system to the Web 3.0 crypto-based native web currencies. The stablecoin TRYB(BiLira) was released in early 2020. As it is a 1:1 fiat backed stablecoin doesn't have any pegging issues due to its nature. BiLira builds a fiat <> crypto on/off ramp for users to interact with global exchanges and DEXs. Aave will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community. Turkey was the worlds fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020. Turkey topped a million trades a day by the end of 2021. BiLira is always fully collateralized and backed 1:1 by TRY fiat reserves. Users control their assets via their own wallets, removing intermediaries and interacting with DeFi. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity) Daily trading volume, market capitalization, and other relevant analytics. Total Issuance: 3,782,105,670 TRY. -Total Redemption: 3,.642,521,623 TRy. -TRYB AUM: 139,584,047TRY. The total size of the media community is over 50,000+ users across all social media platforms. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github) There is no regulation on stablecoins in Turkey. BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey. There haven't been any hacks or vulnerabilities on the project. The project can't be considered a security as TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves. There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRyB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount."

148,[ARC] - ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral,"--- [ARC] - ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral. Status: Discussion. Author: @llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham. Created: 24-10-2022. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves. With the support of the community, Llama will develop ERC4626 strategies that enable Balancer v2 and Curve Liquidity Provider tokens to be deposited as collateral. Users will earn the rewards from the respective Aura Finance and Convex Finance gauges whilst being able to draw a loan against the productive strategies. This new type of collateral is expected to drive borrowing demand for listed assets and generate additional revenue for Aave DAO by sending 5% of the earned rewards to the DAO. Introduction. To support the continued growth of Aave, new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market. Llama proposes onboarding productive assets that are supportive of enhancing capital efficiency through unlocking new utility for user funds. Currently, there is $4.4B deposited in Convex Finance and Aura Finance, and when Optimism enabled liquidity mining on Aave v3, Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave increased almost 13x from $36M to $460M. Llama seeks to create the new type of collateral standard and onboard the first BPT and crvLP as collateral on the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. The new collateral type will be listed with SupplyCaps in place, borrowing disabled, and eMode created to shape how users interact with the new pools. Motivation. To understand how this strategy works, we will first walk through an example that demonstrates the user experience. In this example, the user deposits a BPT into Aave and claims rewards generated by the Aura Finance Gauge. ![|602x137]([link]) The use,r having already invested in a Balancer v2 Liquidity Pool, deposits the BPT into the Aave Reserve and receives back aBPT. The Aave Reserve receives the users BPT and deposits it into an Aura gauge. The rewards generated from staking the BPT in the Aura Finance gauge are claimable by the user without needing to redeem the BPT deposit. When the user claims the rewards, 5% are sent to the DAO and 95% to the user. The productive strategy can also be used as collateral.This creates much more utility for BPTs as users can then borrow against the productive strategy. Apart from levered farming of rewards, users can create buy-now and pay-later strategies that utilize future incentives to pay back the loans. This also creates an opportunity for other communities to build automated strategies that manage rewards and collateralization ratios for users that further streamlines the user experience. ![|602x235]([link]) The DAO can decide if pools such as Balancer Boosted Aave Pool (bb-a-USD) and future GHO pools, (bb-a-USD / GHO) can be listed as collateral. Leverage in this application would exhibit similar recursive behavior to that which is occurring on Optimism and could lead to significant volumes of GHO entering circulation over time. If this was to occur, it would have a positive effect on the DAOs revenue. It is important to note that, although this proposal mentions Balancer and Aura Finance, the same concept applies to Curve and Convex. The initial deployments are to utilize Aura gauges, with a Convex integration to follow. Next Steps. A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral. If the community votes positively for the development of the upgrade to enable the new type of productive collateral to be onboarded, Llama will set about designing and creating the upgrade. Llama will commit to following best practices and working closely with other stakeholders within the community in developing the new collateral type. In the lead up to deployment on the Aave protocol, further governance approval will be required. In the future, the community will also be able to decide via Snapshot whether to provide retroactive funding to reimburse the cost associated with the auditing of the new collateral type and how much funding to provide. A separate Snapshot proposal will emerge where the initial asset listing will be proposed, with contributors such as Gauntlet and others potentially playing a role. Upon agreeing on the initial asset to be listed and whether audit costs are to be reimbursed, an on-chain vote will be submitted for governance approval to transfer funds and introduce the upgrade. This loosely follows the methodology presented in the GHO proposal. Conclusion. This ARC is focused on introducing and getting community feedback on introducing Aaves newest productive collateral to the protocol. We look forward to hearing community feedback on all aspects of this proposal.","This proposal is about introducing a new type of productive collateral to the Aave protocol.

182,[Consensus Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 to Boba Network,"Boba Network and Franklin DAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. Summary. In cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to ICHIs Uniswap v3 management protocols ([link])) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network. Boba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute ([link]) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Bobas Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today. In addition, Boba Network is the first and only multichain ([link]) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team. Proposal. We believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include: Ethereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap. Low cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereums strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum. Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3. Boba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows: The incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network. Security. Boba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimisms Optimistic Rollup codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Bobas state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1. The bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1) In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the ""challenge window) In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and theres a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed. The Boba Network codebase and Optimisms codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities. More details about Boba Network can be found on our engineering roadmap. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Timeline. After passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network, we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote. Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba Network. Yes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba. No - Make no Change. Conclusion. Boba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth. We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback!

216,[BIP-114] Symmetric as the Official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo,"Symmetric as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo. This proposal aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem to Celo, managed by Symmetric,and make Symmetric the official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo. Background: Symmetric is a fork of Balancer that currently runs on the Celo and Gnosis Network, and will soft launch on Kava imminently. The project launched in 2021 and has since deployed a V1 and V2 fork of Balancer on both networks in addition to graduating from Celo Camp. Symmetric has close ties to the Celo community and looks to play a large part in Celos mission-based activity moving forward. Symmetric approached BalancerDAO before launching V2, which did not result in an agreement. Symmetric has since shipped and operated their V2 on Gnosis and Celo in July, while BalancerDAO introduced the veBAL tokenomics, launched on Optimism in collaboration with Beethoven, and the bLabs team added a deployment to Gnosis to their roadmap. Based on these changes, we think its the right moment to re-engage and find a mutually beneficial outcome. Motivation. The Celo Ecosystem, despite relatively low usage, is seeing an increase in interest as the ReFi space native to the chain is growing fast, with projects such as Toucan protocol moving onto Celo recently. Another example is Uniswap moving to Celo with a $10M incentive package from the Celo Foundations DeFi for the People initiative focusing on Green Assets. Another significant point is that PrimeDAO is launching a ReFi Launchpad program on Celo in Q4 with $1M in funds available for project launches and liquidity rewards (bribes) We believe we have the right knowledge, skillset, and network to successfully expand the Balancer protocol onto the Celo network and become one of the top three DEXs on Celo by the end of 2023.

217,[BIP-117] Holdr Friendly Fork Proposal,"Summary. This proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO. Abstract. If approved, this proposal will result in: - Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora. - Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply. - BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply. - Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration. Preface. This proposal is shared by Solaces team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder) Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora) Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Auroras and NEARs ecosystems. Motivation. Both NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there. Background. Solace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M) The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solaces team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer) Specification. Solace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links: - Website (access the app through the link on there): [link] - Smart contracts: [[link]]([link]) Please note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22) Holdr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges. HLDR Supply and Distribution. The total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules: 5% - Balancer. A portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancers treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows: - 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff) - 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows: - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders. - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible. - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum. - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders. - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders. To achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions. 15% - Solace DAO. This allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff. 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury. The Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace teams goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff. 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors. This allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation. 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping. These funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions. Similar to Balancers schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk. Friendly Fork Agreement. If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.","This proposal is seeking support from the Balancer community and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. If approved, this would result in: Solace launching Holdr as the officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora; Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply; BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply; and Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration.

Author: @Llamaxyz, Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, 3SE Holdings & @ItsFreeRealEstate. Status: Proposed. Dated: 2022.11.25. --- Simple Summary. As part of the Sunsetting of v1, the v2 -> v3 Migration & the Deprecation of v2 discussions being conducted by the community [here]([link]) and [here]([link]), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets: - Aave v1 \(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\) - Aave v2 \(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\) Abstract. With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments. Note: The Aave Arc & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the ""Permissioned"" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the ""Permissioned"" code base. Motivation. This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments. Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. Specification. The Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools<!--deployments-->, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses. - Ethereum V1 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V1 Uniswap Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 AMM Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Polygon V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Avalanche V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) References: [Aave v1 Docs]([link]), [Aave v2 Docs]([link]) This represents the first progression toward deprecating the v1 & v2 deployments across all networks.

222,PSP-IPΔ23: ParaSwap Smart Vault Fee Redistribution ,"Simple Summary Mimic is a platform for DeFi automation. By deploying custom Smart Vaults, it can transform centralized manual work into trustless automated actions. Recently, members of the ParaSwap DAO have proposed to implement a Fee Redistribution mechanism as part of their [PSP 2.0 proposal]([link]), in which assets accrued as fees would be converted to a native chain token (eg. ETH), and then distributed between stakers and the DAO treasury. In the current version of the proposal, there is no automated solution for this mechanism. We propose that Mimic Smart Vaults could be used to automatically convert accrued assets into the desired token. Mimic Smart Vault could be deployed in each different layer ParaSwap is in to automate how ParaSwap collects, converts and distributes its protocol fees. Context: About Mimic Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative Smart Vaults concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs. Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults. ![mimic_paraswap]([link]) Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked on many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP, and The Graph. Goals Currently, ParaSwap DAO collects protocol fees in seven layers: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum and Optimism. Assuming that the ParaSwap DAO decides to implement the fee redistribution system proposed in PSP 2.0, We propose to provide ParaSwap DAO with a solution to automate how it collects and distributes its protocol fees to assist with the implementation of this system. To accomplish this, Mimic will deploy customized Smart Vaults owned by ParaSwap DAO, one on each layer. All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when each token reaches a pre-determined value in USDC. Collected PSP and wrapped native chain token will not be converted. Collected chain token will be wrapped All other tokens will be converted to wrapped native chain token. Finally, once a month, those collected tokens will be automatically withdrawn from Mainnet Smart Vault to a ParaSwap smart contract to distribute back to their token holders. Also, it is essential to mention that at all times, the DAO has full ownership and control of all Smart Vaults assets. This means that, for example, at any moment, it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself. Means There will be seven Smart Vaults - one per layer: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions. Some of which will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that ParaSwap DAO designates. Those actions are: - Gather and swap: Gathers assets (except from WETH and ETH) from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and swaps them to WETH (except from PSP) - Gather and wrap: Gathers WETH or ETH from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and if ETH, wraps it into WETH. - Withdraw monthly: Withdraws WETH to a ParaSwap smart contract. - Withdraw: Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner. Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code. Actions won't be allowed to perform any other logic (More information here: [[link]]([link])) In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowments objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. Following the current implementation of PSP 2.0, all smart vaults could initially gather and swap into WETH, and the assets could be bridged to Mainnet for redistribution. If the DAO proposes to implement staking on any of these chains in the future, the parameters of these vaults could also be changed if needed. Metrics: Operational Details 1. Reporting Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 2. Maintenance Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults daily, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will use its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. If a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, the Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes. 3. Fees Mimic will charge a 2% fee for the assets processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD monthly cap. Fees will start at 0% and increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% after a year of execution. 3. a. Test Period The first six epochs of the Mimic implementation will be considered a pilot period to assess the effectiveness of the solutions implemented. After that, fees will increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% (always with a monthly cap) 4. Termination As mentioned before, ParaSwap DAO will fully control its Smart Vaults and the funds deposited into them. This means ParaSwap DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time.

229, [BIP-127] Adding a Gauge for the New qETH/ETH Pool w/2% emissions cap [Ethereum],"Summary: > Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created qETH/ETH pool on Ethereum. References/Useful links: > Link to:  Website:[link]  Documentation: [link]  Github Page: [link]  Communities: [Twitter]([link]), [Discord]([link]), [Telegram]([link]) Protocol Description: >Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. >Tranchess' fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying assets price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation. >Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. Motivation: > The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience. >A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative. Specifications: 1. Governance: Tranchess' governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchesss snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum]([link]) 2. Oracles: Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle. 3. Audits: Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here]([link]) Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program]([link]) with Immunefi. 4. Centralization vectors: The token is not upgradeable or pausable. The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract. Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators. 5. Market History: Link to the pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Link to the gauge: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) 6. Value: The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess. The pool organically grows with Tranchess ETH liquid staking volume, contributing to the Balancer community. Link to the pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Link to the gauge w/2% emissions cap: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Disclaimer The previous vote for an uncapped gauge failed to pass.

272,PTIP-83: PoolTogether V4 DPR Upgrade,"tldr; vote YES to upgrade PoolTogether V4 to support large, infrequent prizes The PoolTogether Inc. team, in collaboration with the Finance Team, has nearly completed the research and development for the V4 ""Draw Percentage Rate"" upgrade. We are now ready to begin rolling out the upgrade. In this post I'll briefly describe the DPR, run through the rollout plan, and finally link to a POOL Snapshot vote that authorizes the Executive Team to upgrade V4. The DPR is the final step in PT Incs plan to further decentralize V4. You can read more about the whole process in the [PT Inc. Protocol Team Q4 2022 TBR]([link]) Draw Percentage Rate tldr; the DPR allows us to have large, infrequent prizes Currently, prizes are awarded in daily draws. The Finance Team sets the total daily prize amount and how that amount is split across prize ""tiers"" Each tier has a certain number of prizes, so the Finance Team may decide to allocate 10% to tier 0 (the grand prize) and 90% to tier 7 (where there are 128 prizes) The problem with the current model is that we can't allocate a portion of the yield to more irregular prizes; to prizes that may occur once per week, for example. This limits our ability to have ""headline prizes""; giant prizes. The upgrade improves on this by introducing the draw percentage rate. The DPR adjust the odds of prizes occurring to ensure that, on average, the prizes will match the expected returns. This is best illustrated with an example! Lets say: - Prizes area allocated in daily draws. - The TVL for a prize pool is $1m. - The total prize amount is $10,000. - The DPR is 0.000274. The Draw Percentage Rate tunes the prize odds so that the daily prizes approximately equal the expected returns. ' Expected Returns = DPR TVL. Expected Returns = 0.000274 $1m = $274. ' The total prize amount is $10,000 so we can calculate the odds adjustment like so: ' Odds adjustment = Expected Returns / Total prize amount. Odds adjustment = $274 / $10,000. Odds adjustment = 0.0274. ' This means that the odds of all prizes will be scaled by 0.0274. The daily grand prize will only occur every (1/0.0274) or 36.5 days. The added benefit of the DPR is that prizes will adjust based on the TVL. As long as the underlying yield APR remains the same, the prize distribution needs to be adjusted far less frequently. Rollout Plan. We're going to roll out the upgrade progressively, in order to minimize risk and ensure there is minimal disruption to prize claiming. The upgrade may cause delays in the ability to claim, but it will not stop prize distribution. Note that these dates are tentative! If there are roadblocks we will progress more slowly, and if the rollout progresses smoothly we can move faster. | Date | Description | | --- | --- | | January 3rd | Finance Team finalizes new prize distribution utilizing the DPR | | January 3rd | Avalanche V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 5th | Ethereum V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 9th | Polygon V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 11th | Optimism V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | Vote.

274,[BIP-142] Permission Granting - Recovery Mode - ComposableStable-V2,"Summary. Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put ComposableStable-V2 pools in Recovery Mode. This proposal is follow up to the [original]([link]) to cover the additional pool factory. Motivation. It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to 'getRate' reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pools internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction. In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper]([link]), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts. The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache. When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool. The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts. The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. This set will now include the [ComposableStable-V2]([link]) pool factory deployed in December. See this previous [proposal]([link]) where Balancer Labs was granted the ability to add/remove factories from this set, given the governance decision to do so. Specification. Grant the following roles to the PoolRecoveryHelpers on each network.

This has come up because faulty rate providers have been causing issues with functions in certain scenarios.

278,[ARC]: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V3 Optimism 2022-12-29,"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust one (1) total risk parameter - Supply Cap - across one (1) Aave V3 Optimism asset. This should reduce risk in the protocol, though it does limit the growth of AAVE deposits on Optimism. Abstract. There is currently not a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aaves v3 deployment on Optimism. We are going to set this quickly and provide a deeper analysis of all of the current supply caps next week. We believe these could be more conservative, but setting a supply cap for AAVE sooner rather than later will reduce the chance of new positions creating a dangerous spike in VaR. Beyond this, the cap greatly reduces the viability of market downturn and price manipulation attacks involving the AAVE token. Motivation. Any market without supply caps could experience an outsize risk by someone opening a very large position quickly. Maintaining supply caps that ensure that one user cannot subject the protocol to outsize risk is a key part of risk management for Aave v3 markets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. This change was driven by analysis focusing on insolvency, as estimated by our simulations. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) The input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Theres limited AAVE liquidity on [Optimism on Uniswap]([link]), with $121k AAVE/ETH being the largest AAVE pool. The current AAVE supply on Optimism Aave v3 is $4.7M, so a liquidator will not be able to arbitrage a large AAVE position solely on Optimism DEXs. However, the liquidation bonus at 10% is high enough that we anticipate liquidators should be willing to hold or bridge AAVE. As the markets on Optimism grow, AAVE will rely more and more on the asset bridge and available cross-chain liquidity. This is why we mentioned that all of these caps could be more conservative, and look forward to sharing more info there next week. If the Aave community wants to take a conservative stance on risk, we should consider lowering these across the board.

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.","This proposal is about adjusting a risk parameter called ""Supply Cap"" across one Aave V3 Optimism asset. The goal of the adjustment is to reduce risk in the protocol, even though it may limit the growth of AAVE deposits on Optimism. Additionally, by setting a supply cap for AAVE, it reduces the chance of new positions creating a dangerous spike in VaR (Value at Risk) and limits market downturns and price manipulation attacks involving the AAVE token. Gauntlet's analysis indicates that these changes are necessary to balance 3 metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Furthermore, they recommend initiating an AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal vote) as soon as possible to get community input on this change.","This proposal is about adjusting a risk parameter called ""Supply Cap"" across one Aave V3 Optimism asset.

This is because when there's no cap, one person could potentially supply so many tokens it could risk the safety of the whole system. This limit would also help to tackle issues like price manipulation. We reached this decision after doing a lot of market simulations and analyses. It's important to know that this plan isn't just based on some numbers we've crunched, but on a range of data that changes daily, from trade volumes to how likely insolvencies are. The supply cap we have in mind is 100,000 AAVE, but we're open to discussing more conservative caps. We're aware of the Uniswap AAVE/ETH liquidity issue, and anticipate that liquidators should be okay with this since the 10% liquidation bonus makes holding or bridging AAVE appealing. Ultimately, by approving this, the Aave community safeguards the platform from high risk.","This proposal suggests implementing a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aave's v3 deployment on Optimism, which will reduce the risk in the protocol and prevent potential market manipulation attacks. The reasoning behind this is that without a supply cap, someone could open a large position quickly and pose a significant risk to the protocol. The current AAVE supply on Optimism is $4.7M, and while there is limited liquidity for AAVE on Optimism's DEXs, the liquidation bonus is high enough to incentivize liquidators to hold or bridge AAVE. The proposal recommends a supply cap of 100,000 AAVE, and the community is encouraged to consider lowering supply caps across the board for a more conservative risk approach. A snapshot vote will be initiated, and the proposed changes are part of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations based on their simulation engine's analysis of the market data.","The proposal is to set a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aaves v3 deployment on Optimism in order to reduce risk in the protocol.

283,[OIP-126] Self-Repaying OHM: Alchemix alOHM Launch Support,"Summary. Support Alchemix in launching a self-repaying OHM product (alOHM) by 1) providing them with $50k in liquidity incentivization support per quarter for a total of two quarters, and 2) adding 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity. Background. Alchemix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset protocol that gives users advances on various yield strategies via a synthetic token. The Alchemix loans are self-repaying, interest-free and non-liquidating. Today, Alchemix offers various strategies to borrow against select USD-pegged stablecoins (alUSD) and ETH (alETH) Alchemixs focus over the last months has been to expand cross-chain and to deploy new yield strategies for the existing alAssets. In parallel, the Alchemix and Olympus teams have also been exploring the creation of a new alAsset and to launch alOHM as the next product. This self-repaying OHM loan product has been frequently requested by both communities in the past, and with this proposal (and the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here) we offer both communities the opportunity to make this a reality. For Olympus, alOHM represents a novel use case that adds further utility to the token. Ohmies will be able to take out liquidation and interest free loans, enjoy similar Alchemix strategies for alOHM as for alUSD and alETH, as well as LP the alOHM/OHM pool. From the protocols perspective, it is invaluable for other protocols to build on top of the OHM monetary layer and so we want to support the (first) teams doing so. As a piece of background information, the feasibility of creating new alAssets for Alchemix depends on various factors, such as demand, a sustainable yield source, and a clear path towards profitability. The major expense for Alchemix to launch a new product is the creation and incentivization of a new liquidity pool for the synthetic asset. As such, this proposal focuses on support for bootstrapping alOHM liquidity that will make the product become sustainable over time (and able to operate independently without direct Olympus support after the bootstrapping period) alOHM details. The alOHM vault will launch with the following parameters: - Accepted collateral: OHM, gOHM. - Deposit cap: 1,000,000 OHM. - LTV%: 50% At launch, it will have a single yield strategy which uses the OHM ARR for the self-repaying loan. In the future, if additional yield sources are available that Alchemix supports, these could potentially be added as well. In terms of an alOHM/OHM liquidity pool, both teams have agreed that Balancer is the preferred choice. Not only would alOHM/OHM route directly into the existing OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pools, Balancer/Aura currently also offers a more favourable incentivization/bribe multiplier than competitors. For more details on the vault workings and specifications, please visit the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here: [link] Olympus support. In order to make this product feasible to deploy for Alchemix, and to help bootstrap the launch, Alchemix has requested Olympuss support for the following two things. First, Olympus would help co-incentivize the liquidity pool during the initial bootstrapping period. More specifically, this would be support in the form of $50k per quarter for a total of two (2) quarters. Alchemix will combine these funds with up to 500 ALCX/week to incentivize/bribe the pool in order to attract liquidity. Second, Olympus would deploy 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity at the start. These funds would be sourced from previously inverse-bonded OHM. By creating the LP token, Olympus would be earning trading fees as well as BAL/AURA rewards (assuming the gauge vote for the pool passes, and after staking the LP tokens) Note that for Alchemix the launch of alOHM is dependent on support during the bootstrapping period and that without it the product is likely not feasible to be deployed at this time.","This proposal is about supporting Alchemix in launching a new self-repaying product called alOHM by providing them with $50,000 in liquidity incentivization support each quarter for two quarters and adding 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap its liquidity. This will allow Alchemix users to take out liquidation and interest free loans, as well as LP the alOHM/OHM pool.

293,SIP#25 - Stargate MM (Revised Proposal),"Background. Stargates token, STG, is traded both on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs) STG is listed on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin among others. Proposal. Market makers provide a key service within centralized exchanges, by offering deep liquidity on both sides of a market (on both the bid and ask side) This results in deep liquidity being available on both sides of the book allowing market participants to interact with the token freely (buy and sell amounts without moving the price dramatically) Without a market maker a exchanges orderbook tends to become illiquid, which could in turn lead to a poor user experience when interacting with the asset on that exchange. This can lead to an exchange deprioritizing or delisting that asset. Many of the largest centralized exchanges actually encourage an active market maker as a point of reference. Market makers typically adhere to certain service level agreements (SLAs) covering a range of obligations such as spread, quote depth, uptime and other metrics to continually ensure a smooth functioning market. In exchange for these services, market makers are usually either paid a fee for services rendered or compensated by a structured 'call' option that keeps them aligned with the asset they're market making for. An example of an agreement is that the market maker may ensure $X depth within Y percent slippage for the asset and ensure they are available and servicing the market at least 99% of the time. After a fixed term they then will either return the asset borrowed for market making or a cash equivalent at a predetermined strike price. Market makers typically require a loan of assets. Assets being loaned are important to a market maker because it allows them to service both sides of the market. An active market maker needs to be able to both buy an asset around its current price but also sell an asset around that same price to ensure market participants have enough liquidity to suit their desires around accumulating or divesting an asset. Numerous market makers have submitted proposals with loan requests ranging from 5,000,000 to 50,000,000 tokens and varying strike prices, some of which were below the actual current spot price. A competitive offer from a high reputable firm is key to successful market making in this environment. Combining a reputable custodian of the loan who has a track record of safeguarding client funds with a smaller loan size and a strike price that is significantly higher than the current market price ensures the party selected is vetted and aligned towards the long term success of Stargate. Execution. STG would be made available to a suitable and qualified market maker for STG under terms that do not exceed a loan of 8,000,000 STG for a 24 month period. The up to 8,000,000 STG are loaned to a market maker who will then use them to support free flowing liquidity of STG across multiple venues. The market maker will take no fees for this service but will be given an option to buy the STG after the term expires at predetermined prices. This helps align their upside for services rendered with Stargates. They will help support a free flowing and robust market and any upside of token appreciation during that tenure is their reward for doing so. After the term, STG would be returned to The Foundation or an equivalent amount of USDC at a price of $0.80 or above per STG. The exact amount per STG will be equal to or higher than $0.80 but a floor is set to provide confidence in the number while also not revealing any data that would compromise market integrity. Success. If successful, A qualified market maker will be chosen with a strike price on the option granted of at least $0.80 (with goals of significantly higher) after a 24 month term. This will enable liquidity to be deeper across all centralized exchanges allowing for market participants to buy and/or sell STG more easily. Summary. The Stargate DAO shall loan up to 8,000,000 STG for a term of not more than 24 months to a qualified market maker to maintain liquidity for STG token. This will create more robust centralized exchange liquidity and allow for a better functioning STG market both on and off chain.

332,TAP-16 Pilot Opyn Strategies Deposits,"Summary: Whitelist the Opyn Crab V2 Strategy for Olympus treasury deposits. The goal of these vaults is to allow ETH exposure to increase decentralization but reduce the overall volatility of ETH. Upon approval we will deposit 150E (~$225k) each into the two available Opyn strategies (Crab USDC and Zen Bull) Following six months of deposit period, we will share the performance of these two deposits - the vaults automatically rebalance MWF. Background: OIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. This proposal seeks to add Opyns Crab V2 Strategy to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap. As this is a whitelist proposal, a risk analysis was performed and can be found below. About Crab: Opyn is a DeFi options protocol and the team that designed and developed the smart contracts for Squeeth, a power perpetual tracking ETH2 in the form of the ERC-20 oSQTH. Crab is an automated short-volatility, delta-neutral vault strategy that allows depositors to reap the benefits of shorting oSQTH without taking a view on if the price of ETH will move up or down. By creating a mix of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral, Crab earns returns in USD terms when price of ETH fluctuates within a relatively stable range with periods of low volatility (compared to market expectations) The vault regularly rebalances via a recurring batch auction that allows Crab to buy or sell a target amount of oSQTH to neutralize delta. More about Crab V2: Overview. Auction Example. Depositing, Withdrawing, & Hedging. FAQs. Squeeths Delta. Motivation: Crab V2 provides a short volatility, delta-neutral strategy that aims to earn returns on the treasurys plethora of idle ETH assets. Delta-neutrality can allow the treasury to earn USD-denominated returns without taking a position on the price of ETH itself. The treasury is currently long ETH and recent market fluctuations have frequently oscillated the dollar value of the treasury. The delta-neutral strategy aims for (1) rapid drops in ETH price to have a less significant impact on the Olympus treasurys dollar value and (2) generating USD-denominated returns when ETH moves less than peoples expectations (between hedges) Risks: Vulnerability: A vulnerability in the Crab V2 or Squeeth smart contracts could lead to partial or complete loss of funds. Crab V2 has been audited and is insured by Sherlock and Squeeth has been audited by Trail of Bits and Akira. Liquidation: While Crab Strategy deposits can be liquidated if it falls below the safe-collateralization ratio of 150%, rebalancing on a time-based or ETH-price-changes threshold helps prevent a liquidation from occurring. Crab has never been liquidated to date. ETH Price Movement & Volatility: If there are changes to implied volatility or the price of ETH moves by more than is implied by the Squeeth funding, Crab can lose money. Slippage: Crab can experience slippage when rebalancing (depending on clearing price from the batch auction) or due to price impact when deposits trigger a Uniswap sell. Protocol Analysis: Using a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. [link]","This proposal is suggesting that the Olympus treasury deposits should use Opyn's Crab V2 Strategy to increase decentralization while reducing the overall volatility of ETH. This means that up to 33% of excess treasury reserves could be deposited into this strategy, and 150E (~$225k) will be deposited each into two available strategies (Crab USDC and Zen Bull). After six months, the performance of these two deposits will be monitored - the vaults rebalance MWF (Monday, Wednesday & Friday). The protocol has been audited for safety and insured by Sherlock. The goal is to earn USD-denominated returns without taking a position on the price of ETH itself. However there are risks such as slippage when rebalancing or liquidation if it falls below a safe collateralization ratio.","This proposal is suggesting that the Olympus treasury deposits should use Opyns Crab V2 Strategy to increase decentralization while reducing the overall volatility of ETH.

Specifically, it suggests using about $225,000 of Ethereum to join two methods (Crab USDC and Zen Bull) offered by Opyn, which specializes in Decentralized Finance options. After six months, we'll see how these investments have done. The great thing about Opyn's strategy is that it aims to make money whether the Ethereum price goes up or down, and it shouldn't lose a lot of money if the Ethereum price suddenly drops. Some risks to remember include potential bugs or security threats in Opyn's systems and unpredictable changes in Ethereum's price and market behavior.

Additional $1B of TVL + huge trading volume + earned fees for LPs 1-2M new users + UNI holders Huge respect and appreciation from DeFi devs More adoption for Uniswap NFT Platform (as BNB chain has a weak infra for NFTs) Financial Incentives for Liquidity. We can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and [Quadrat Protocol]([link]) for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users. Security and Governance Bridge. 0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using [Celer Bridge]([link]) for the Governance cross-chain messaging. Here is a piece of information about the Celer Bridge provided by @modong. A quick introduction to Celer: Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users. How to build Uniswaps cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models) Celer IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap]([link]) since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the [application design pattern]([link]) When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage]([link]) of a ""send box contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision. This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain. A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call [executeMessage]([link]) of a ""receive box contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract. The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain. However, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the second security model: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a ""quarantine zone for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from ""trust majority stake to ""trust any with app developers capable of running one of the ""any App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module. Once the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process. Next, we answer the questions raised in the post. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Of course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? This is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description. As discussed above, Celers generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celers security models: Celer comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis. 1. Cosmos-consensus Security Model. By default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELRs value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions. 2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model (what should be used in this case) !(upload://8uf1PmN8Xra57O4ORLU5SjzZ2AW) So, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario. Instead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be ""committed to the blockchain by SGN into a ""quarantine zone for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be ""confirmed and pushed to the final destination application. During this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celers construct will still maintain safety property without any concern. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the ""trust-any model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain. This is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Their CELR stake will be slashed. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Celer was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the ""[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script.]([link]) 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.","This proposal is asking for authorization for 0xPlasma Labs to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol on the BNB PoS Chain.

","The proposal suggests authorizing 0xPlasma Labs to deploy Uniswap v3 protocol on the BNB PoS Chain. This is seen as a good opportunity because the BNB Chain has a large and growing user base, offers fast transactions and low fees, and is part of the popular Binance ecosystem.

BNB Chain could provide opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other projects on the Binance ecosystem. Binance has a global presence and a strong brand, which could help increase awareness and adoption of Unis wap. BNB Chain has a robust ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, providing potential opportunities for collaboration and co-development. BNB Chains support for on-chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven development model.

Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol. It enables a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Cler IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap] since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage] The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision. This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract. The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available. Cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. During the quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains. SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. 2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model. A two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. The message has to be ""committed to the blockchain by SGN into a ""quarantine zone for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be ""confirmed and pushed to the final destination application.

336,Kanpai 2.0 [Implementation],"This proposals expectation is to produce an implementation. Full details and discussions thus far can be found at: [link] Following snapshot is for this proposals signal to advance to this implementation vote: [link] Synopsis: With the introduction of Kanpai and a Treasury Payout Ratio, this proposal is a modification of the previously set payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury. Payout Ratio to the Treasury will stay in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. Premise of the proposal is roughly the same from the signal vote, but with clear guidelines set in place for the timeline of the enacted proposal. The proposal ensures that the 100% ratio of fees to the Treasury will only be in effect for a maximum of one year from when the signal vote passed on Dec 19th 2022. Thus, this means that a hard-stop will be in place for Dec 19th 2023 and the Kanpai payout ratio will revert back to 10% to Treasury and 100% to Sushi Bar. Also, implementation of new tokenomics will also be a cause for a hard stop on the fee re-direct and migrating to the new structure once its passed through governance/development and is ready to integrate. Additionally, a governance dashboard will be developed to give full transparency & insights into the operations budget and the treasurys assets. To summarize the proposal seeks to direct 100% of the revenue earned through fees to the Treasury, with two conditions causing a hard stop: 1. A year has passed with no tokenomics in place (Dec 19th 2023) 2. New tokenomics being implemented. Revenue to the treasury will be in the form of 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass. TLDR: 100% fees to the Treasury with a hard-stop in 1 year or when new tokenomics are implemented. Sushi Gov dashboard to follow with full transparency in the DAOs spending and revenue","This proposal is about directing 100% of the fees earned from Sushi to their treasury for a maximum period of one year. After that time, or if new tokenomics are implemented, the amount directed to the treasury will revert back to 10%. Also, a governance dashboard will be created so that people can see where exactly these funds are being allocated. The expectation is that over this next year they should bring in around $6 million dollars in revenue.","This proposal is about directing 100% of the fees earned from Sushi to their treasury for a maximum period of one year.

The expectation is that over this next year they should bring in around $6 million dollars in revenue.","This proposal suggests that all the fees we earn from Sushi (a type of cryptocurrency) should go straight to our Treasury fund for a year, or until we establish new rules for handling our digital money (tokenomics). This change would replace the current method where only 10% of the fees go to the Treasury. If passed, the new rule would stop by December 19, 2023, or if our new tokenomics are ready earlier. We will also build a tool to track and show how the DAO (our kind of organization) uses its funds. This new plan could potentially earn us nearly $6 million throughout the next year, in the form of 50% Ethereum (another type of cryptocurrency) and 50% USDC (a digital version of USD).","This proposal suggests changing the payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury for a year, or until new tokenomics are implemented. After the year is up or new tokenomics are established, the payout ratio will go back to 10% to the Treasury and 100% to the Sushi Bar. A governance dashboard will be created to provide transparency on the budget and assets of the Treasury. The revenue to the Treasury will be split equally between ETH and USDC, with an estimated earnings of around $6 million in the next year if the proposal is approved.","The proposal is about changing how much money (fees) earned from Sushi will go to the treasury. Right now, 10% goes to the treasury and 100% goes to the Sushi Bar. The proposal is to change this so that 100% of the fees will go to the treasury instead. This will be in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. After one year or new tokenomics are in place, the payout ratio will go back to 10% to the treasury and 100% to the Sushi Bar. A governance dashboard will also be made so that people can see how the money is being spent by the DAO. To summarize, this proposal would result in all fees earned from Sushi going to the treasury (instead of just 10%) for one year or until new tokenomics are put in place and a governance dashboard will be created for transparency in spending and revenue.",This proposal is a modification of the previously set payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury.

370,[HIP-17] Deploy Hop bridge functionality on the ConsenSys zkEVM rollup,"' Author: Cameron O'Donnell. Email: . Telegram: @DAOstrat. ' Intro. gm Hop community! Cameron here on behalf of ConsenSys. We are proud to engage with such an active community. Most people know ConsenSys for Metamask, Infura, and Truffle, but we're here to talk about something else: a zkEVM Rollup. We recently launched the [Testnet]([link]) (open only for allowlist users) and are reaching out to propose deploying Hop for the ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet and subsequent Mainnet. ConsenSys follows the progression of the Hop ecosystem closely and even recently integrated Hop into our [bridging aggregator]([link]) Hop is a unique and critical piece of infrastructure that seamlessly bridges assets between chains. Proposal Details. Proposal. This proposal asks the Hop community to support bridging using the protocol between the ConsenSys zkEVM and other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Specifically, this will integrate various protocol features with the trustless ConsenSys zkEVM token bridge. This will help provide sufficient bridging liquidity for future Testnet users. (330K signups as of today) ConsenSys team members are in contact with Authereum (DBA Hop Labs) and are excited to work on this together. Motivation. What is particularly exciting about the ConsenSys zkEVM is that it is a type 2 zkEVM. As a result, it is EVM equivalent, meaning existing smart contracts, toolsets, and release processes can be easily deployed without substantial modifications. This means de minimis switching costs for dApp developers. During the Testnet phases and Mainnet, we expect a robust user base that will drive activity to the Hop protocol (and community) as demand for bridging increases. Also, the protocol will be the first to integrate with the native zkEVM bridge, which is a significant opportunity for the Hop ecosystem. Bridge Deployments. Bridges play a key role in Layer 2 Rollups; we look at it as one of the central pillars of the tech stack. Currently, we are running a native trustless messaging and token bridge used for ERC20s from Layer 1. In addition, as strong supporters of Hop, We forked the Hop frontend and adopted it for this first phase of the zkEVM Testnet. Bridges and related contracts are deployed and managed by the core protocol dev team with support from ConsenSys. Authereum is aware of the considerations and excited to work with us on the ConsenSys zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM. Type 2 zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper. Unlike other rollups, the Consensys zkEVM does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks. Timeline/Next Steps. The Request For Comment was posted in the Forums on January 19, 2023. The proposal is now posted in Snapshot. Once these steps are completed, we will team up with a Delegate to post the On-chain proposal. Conclusion. Consensys looks forward to strengthening our partnership with Hop through direct integrations. Supporting bridging to and from the ConsenSys zkEVM will allow for a seamless user experience and drive growth for the Hop ecosystem. We look forward to the discussion below!","This proposal is about integrating the Hop protocol with the ConsenSys zkEVM to allow for seamless bridging between various chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.

384,[ARFC] wETH Interest Rate Curve - Ethereum v2,"--- title: [ARFC] wETH Interest Rate Curve - Ethereum v2. Discussion: [link] Short description: Upgrade wETH interest rate on Ethereum v2 to match Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. author: @Llamaxyz - Defi_Consulting. dated: 2023-01-29. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Following on from the forum discussion relating to wETH and wstETH interest rates across Ethereum v2 and v3, this Snapshot will focus on implementing the wETH interest rate parameter changes on Aave v2. Since the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. This proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend. Motivation. Since AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch) The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aaves wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below. !([link]]) The market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below: Structured products charge a fee Additional smart contract risk Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity. Our analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed. This proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1% The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1) Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. The graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves. !([link]]) The graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed. !([link]]) It is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95% Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced. The chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve. !([link]]) Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment. |Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)| | --- | --- | --- | |Uoptimal|80.00|80.00| |Base|0.00|1.00| |Slope1|5.75|3.80| |Slope2|80.00|80.00| |Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00| Copyright. Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0]([link])","This proposal is about adjusting the interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool for wETH. The goal of this change is to increase borrowing demand and overall revenue by lowering the Slope1 parameter from 5.75% to 3.8%, introducing a Base of 1%, and reducing the borrowing rate at the Upotiaml point from 5.75% to 4.8%. It is expected that these changes will lead to more users entering into recursive lending loops, which in turn will increase utilization and revenue for Aave's liquidity pool on Ethereum v2 network.","This proposal is about adjusting the interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool for wETH.

This is to boost the use of the v2 wETH reserve and slow down a drop in revenue. Despite steady deposits of stETH to borrow wETH since a previous update, actual borrowing has lessened, hinting there's not enough demand. This might be due to extra fees, risk, or exposure. The solution proposed is to cut the current interest rate known as Slope1, from 5.75% to 3.8%, and add a Base rate of 1%. This adjustment is expected to encourage users to borrow more. The proposal also suggests that at less than 41% utilization, borrowing costs are higher, while at over 41%, borrowing costs are lower. The current utilization is 46%, meaning borrowing costs would actually be reduced.","This proposal suggests updating the interest rate for wETH on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool to match the rates on Ethereum v3. Currently, there is a decline in the total value locked and daily revenue on Aave, so this change aims to increase the utilization of the wETH reserve and improve revenue. The proposal suggests lowering the interest rate parameters to make borrowing wETH more attractive, addressing the reduced demand for borrowing. The proposed changes would slightly increase borrowing costs at lower utilization but decrease them at higher utilization. Overall, this adjustment aims to align the wETH interest rates across different deployments and improve the performance of Aave's liquidity pool.","This proposal is discussing implementing changes to the wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. It is anticipated that by adjusting these rates, there will be an increased utilization of the reserve and an offsetting of declining revenues due to lower borrowing demand.","Proposal to amend wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2.

399,"[Ideation] SCP-123 Engineering Workstream Renewal, February - May 2023","Engineering Workstream Renewal, February - May 2023. Abstract / Overview. The ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the open source code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, support integrations from the broader community, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the DAOs vision. This proposal is to fund the Engineering Workstreams budget from February 1st, 2023 through May 31st, 2023 inclusive. This proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader [link] Motivation. Previous proposal. The Engineering workstream came in under budget of the previously approved proposal Total labor, infrastructure, and overhead spend of ~$397,810 USDC against an approved $496,540 [link] Approximately 400,000 FOX spent on bounties against an approved dollar amount of $100,000.

Team [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Workstream Leader & Senior Engineer [[hexadecimals]potheosis]([link]) - Senior Engineer [gomes]([link]) - Senior Engineer [kaladinlight]([link]) - Senior Engineer. Mandate. This proposal seeks to have the Engineering Workstream be the sole maintainers with discretion over CODEOWNERS, permissions and administrative rights of the ShapeShift GitHub repository. The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation. This is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase. The Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability. Budget spreadsheet. The details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet [link] Recurring costs. Labor Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof. The budget includes provision for two new open positions at a rate of up to $210,000 each, denominated in USDC. Infrastructure. The Engineering Workstream pays a managed-services provider, TaxiStake, for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform and mobile app. Infrastructure costs exceeded our forecasts in the previous budget cycle, due to multiple factors. A migration of the development cluster from the Fox Foundation to under the DAOs control, via TaxiStake. The development cluster is necessary for addition of new nodes/chains, local and hosted development environments, upgrades, rolling out breaking changes with blue/green deployments etc. This is another progressive decentralization step, where the costs of the development cluster were hidden and previously absorbed by the Fox Foundation. Addition of archival nodes to the infrastructure. Within this budget cycle, this will allow us to remove reliance on Etherscan for internal transaction data required for balance and transaction history, and Infura for archival node data. Node snapshots of synced or syncing nodes - cloud storage costs are expensive. Additional EVM chains, namely Optimism - EVM nodes are expensive by virtue of storage and data. The following factors are expected to increase the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle: the addition of more EVM chains, namely Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, requiring archival node syncs, and multiple snapshots, and data ingress. The following factors are expected to decrease the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle: Negotiated lower margin with TaxiStake. Previously a 50% markup was applied to the underlying infrastructure costs, this has been reduced to 30% Removal of EVM full nodes (Ethereum/Avalanche/Optimism), once archival nodes are fully synced. Removal of outdated snapshot data for currently syncing nodes. Migration of API layer from 'eu-west-1' to 'us-east-1', reducing application layer costs by 50%, though this may not be worth the labor cost to enact. TaxiStake is currently forecasting a bottom line cost of $22,100 for February. The numerous factors above make an accurate forecast difficult. Overall, we are expecting a slight net increase in costs, and are requesting $120,000 USDC for expected infrastructure costs, based on an expected maximum $30,000 for four months. Failure to cover these costs will lead to a 100% production outage. Non-recurring costs. Bounty Program. As discussed and largely agreed within the community, the bounty program in its previous form had significant flaws. We are requesting $8,000/month worth of FOX, ~200,000 FOX at current prices, to provision for further experiments with tightly controlled scopes of work that are timely and aligned with the shared roadmap where possible. Miscellaneous. The budget also contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineerings discretion. The line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO. This budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX for non-recurring costs. Contingency. Unforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly. The budget seeks approval for $52,800 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstreams discretion, shall it be required. Variance. Unused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle. In the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised. Deliverables. Goals. The Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal(s) The workstream exists to execute on the shared DAO Roadmap Proposal SCP-121: Roadmap Proposal Jan - Mar 31, 2023 [link] The DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market. The product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined. Reporting. The Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods availability via Discord, covering most time zones weekly product/engineering public meetings weekly governance calls on demand for any specific deliverable. Should the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits. Benefits. Fundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered. Drawbacks. Engineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAOs budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized. Vote.

402, Infinity Keys x Aavegotchi Paartnership [Updated Numbers],"Author(s): Andy Boyan and chair. GotchiID: 13482. This sigprop is for funding the Infinity Keys Aavegotchi Onboarding Hunt. Infinity Keys put forth a discussion forum post here: [[link]]([link]), has attended several Saturday Hangouts and Sunday DAO meetings to discuss their proposal, and include longtime members of the Aavegotchi community. If you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr. - 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new plays, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives. - 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a paccode hidden in the gotchiverse. - These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play. - At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants. - There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops. - Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi. One question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And whats more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete. We have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community more players will come test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi. One of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point. This onboarding comes from a deep understanding of the Gotchi community and how the system functions from an insiders perspective, but has the Alchemica to reach new players and bring them in. ![[image]]([link])","This proposal is about a series of gamified challenges for players to get familiar with the Aavegotchi game before they make a purchase decision. There are four challenges that involve playing games and solving puzzles related to Gotchi lore, holding or renting a Gotchi, petting a Gotchi and finding passcodes hidden in the gotchiverse. There will also be prizes awarded through treasure incentives as well as drawings from participants who have completed these achievements. This campaign aims to bring more people into Aavegotchi by providing an easier way for them to try it without having to invest heavily upfront.","This proposal is about a series of gamified challenges for players to get familiar with the Aavegotchi game before they make a purchase decision.

The game includes different challenges such as solving a code based on Aavegotchi lore, owning or renting a Gotchi, interacting with a Gotichi, and a secret code to find in the digital world. The game is open-ended and winning players will receive various Tickets. This is seen as an important way to promote Aavegotchi, by giving new members a chance to get to know the community before fully investing. While the outcome isn't guaranteed, the aim is to grow the community as much as possible.

403,TAP 20: Deposit Idle Frax into FraxBP,"Simple Summary. Deposit $33 million of idle Frax into USDC / Frax (FraxBP) and stake on Convex. Background. Olympus currently has ~$58 million of Frax, of which $25 million is deposited in the FraxBP and staked on Convex. The remainder is sitting idly in the treasury, earning no yield. Motivation. As of this writing, the pool is projected to yield ~4.95% APR including FXS rewards. The incremental $33 million deposited and staked would earn the protocol an additional ~$1.6 million per year. Given the risk profiles of the two assets in the pool  USDC and Frax  the risk of LPing is no greater than holding Frax ""naked (i.e., if Frax were to depeg, the pool would end up all Frax  exactly where we stand today) Of course, there is smart contract risk, but both Curve and Convex have proved to be extremely robust. Proposal. Deposit the remaining $33 million to the FraxBP and stake on Convex. This proposal would not preclude Olympus from pursuing other opportunities. The FraxBP should be viewed as the ""base camp"" for Frax holdings, with its yield serving as a hurdle rate for other deployments.","This proposal suggests that Olympus should deposit $33 million of their idle Frax into USDC / Frax (FraxBP) and stake it on Convex. By doing this, the protocol is projected to earn an additional ~$1.6 million per year since the pool would yield ~4.95% APR including FXS rewards. As there is no greater risk in staking the assets than holding them “naked”, Olympus can pursue other opportunities with this base camp serving as a hurdle rate for such deployments.","This proposal suggests that Olympus should deposit $33 million of their idle Frax into USDC / Frax (FraxBP) and stake it on Convex.

As there is no greater risk in staking the assets than holding them ""naked, Olympus can pursue other opportunities with this base camp serving as a hurdle rate for such deployments.","This proposal suggests putting the unused $33 million of Frax into a USDC/Frax (FraxBP) pool and using it on Convex. Right now, Olympus has about $58 million in Frax, with $25 million already in the FraxBP pool on Convex, and the rest not earning any interest. This plan could make Olympus an additional $1.6 million yearly, as the pool is expected to yield around 4.95% yearly, including FXS rewards. This isn't riskier than just holding onto Frax, and since Curve and Convex have been reliable, the contract risk isn't big. The idea is to put the remaining $33 million in FraxBP and use it on Convex, but Olympus would still be open to other opportunities. Consider the FraxBP pool as the starting point for our Frax holdings, with any earnings being a benchmark for other placements.","This proposal suggests taking $33 million of unused Frax cryptocurrency and depositing it into a pool with USDC, called FraxBP. The funds in this pool would then be staked on Convex, a platform that allows users to earn rewards. By doing so, the protocol could earn an additional $1.6 million per year. The risk involved is similar to holding Frax alone, but with the added benefit of earning rewards. This proposal serves as a starting point for managing Frax holdings, with the earnings acting as a baseline for future investments.","The proposal is to take the remaining $33 million of Frax that Olympus has and put it into a pool with USDC called FraxBP. This pool will then be staked on the Convex Protocol, earning yield for the protocol. This additional yield is estimated to be about $1.6 million per year. The risk of this activity is no greater than just holding the Frax ""naked"" since both Curve and Convex have proven to be robust in the past. This proposal does not prevent Olympus from pursuing other opportunities, but it does provide a base camp for their Frax holdings and sets a minimum yield target for any future deployments.","Olympus currently has $58 million of Frax, of which $25 million is deposited in the FraxBP and staked on Convex.

407,[GIP-42] Accounting locked in Curve LP GEARs in DAO Governance,"Motivation. There are currently ~900 million GEAR in circulation. At the same time, ~100 million GEAR are locked in Curve LP (you can see exact amount [here]([link])) Many of those who provide liquidity in Curve have participated in cidered liquidity and are active members of the community. Therefore, it seems fair to give them also the right to participate in the Governance. Implementation. 1. Consider that the LP position of user has a GEAR in the amount. 'GEAR balance on curve balanceOfLP(holder) / totalLPSupply' , where. - 'GEAR balance on curve' shows how much GEAR are on LP pool contract ([hexadecimals]) - balanceOfLP - users balance of Curve LP tokens. - totalLPSupply - total Supply of Curve LP tokens. 2. Users balance of Curve LP tokens (balanceOfLP) is calculated as sum of Curve LP tokens on his wallet, Curve LP tokens staked by him into Curve Gauge and Curve LP tokens staked by him into Convex. Disclaimer. This proposal is to allow governance to function and reach quorums, which have always been hard to achieve - but now almost impossible. As such, while governance remains in the snapshot<>multisig model, some decisions value speed over fine print. Therefore, in case snapshot governance gets attacked due to Curve pool manipulation [this proposal done doesn't allow for dummy manipulations, but it wasn't fully audited either] - snapshot admins reserve the right to make a post-mortem and make the attacker proposal void. That is per the rules described in the docs (which have remained unchanged since before the DAO inception [link]) Later on, once governance becomes fully on-chain, any such oversight actions would not be possible or technically feasible. But thats a question to solve in the next steps. For now, the model improvement suggested should do its job and allow for swift transition. Conclusion. I propose to add voting power for Curve LP holders according to the logic described above","This proposal is about giving Curve LP holders voting power in the GEAR Governance system. The user's vote will be determined by their balance of Curve LP tokens, including any Curve LP tokens on their wallet and those staked into Convex or Gauge. The hope is that this will help reach quorum more easily and make governance decisions quicker, but if the system gets attacked due to manipulation then snapshot admins can act accordingly and void any attacker proposal.","This proposal is about giving Curve LP holders voting power in the GEAR Governance system.

The hope is that this will help reach quorum more easily and make governance decisions quicker, but if the system gets attacked due to manipulation then snapshot admins can act accordingly and void any attacker proposal.","The goal of this proposal is to increase participation in GEAR governance by considering Curve LP tokens held by users as part of their GEAR balance. In short, this involves adding the amount of GEAR a user has in the Curve liquidity pool to their total GEAR balance, making it possible for them to vote in governance decisions. It's important to note that this system is designed to prevent misuse, but it hasn't been fully audited. If an issue is detected, admins can reverse any damaging actions. In the long run, this should encourage more participation and decision-making within the GEAR community.","The proposal suggests giving liquidity providers in Curve LP, who already hold GEAR, the right to participate in the governance of the project. This is because many of these providers have actively supported the project and are important members of the community. The implementation involves considering the GEAR balance of LP holders in relation to the total LP supply, taking into account the LP tokens held in wallets, staked in Curve Gauge, and staked in Convex. It is important to note that while this proposal aims to improve governance efficiency, it also allows for swift actions in case of attacks or manipulation, subject to post-mortem analysis. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the voting power and participation of Curve LP holders in the project's governance.","The proposal is to give voting power to users who have provided liquidity in the Curve LP pool. This would be done by taking into account the amount of GEAR held in the LP position of the user, and giving them a corresponding amount of voting power. This is being done to help increase the speed and efficiency of the governance system.","There are currently ~900 million GEAR in circulation.

408, [BIP-166] Whitelist the gauge for the StaFi rETH/ETH Pool to receive BAL emissions,"PR with payload: [link] Authors: StaFi Contributors, with support from Aura contributors Summary StaFi proposes the creation of a Balancer gauge for a rETH-ETH pool on mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap. Protocol Description StaFi is a liquid staked derivatives protocol launched in Q3 2020, with a focus on bringing liquidity to staked assets on Ethereum and other Proof of Stake chains such as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Since launch, the protocol has accrued over $36,000,000 worth of staked assets across 11 tokens, with 3,439 active validators. Similar to other LSD protocols, StaFi issues a liquid receipt token (rETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissionless validator set. Deposits are partially covered by validator deposits. The exchange rate between rETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though rETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Shanghai upgrade. StaFi has a native governance token with the ticker ""FIS. FIS is freely tradable on a number of centralized exchanges, alongside some decentralized exchanges not inclusive of Balancer. FIS has governance utility and can be staked by validators in the StaFi consensus network. Motivation StaFi currently has an[existing rETH-ETH pool]([link]) on Curve that sees regular trades between both assets. StaFi is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its staked derivatives, starting with rETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Shanghai Ethereum hard fork, liquidity and yield on LSDs will be a key competing factor as LSD protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders. StaFi is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual. Specifications 1. Governance: [DAO forum]([link]) 2. Oracles: Direct Balance Query: The rETH rateProvider has a getRate function that calls rETHs own getExchangeRate function. See the [contract here]([link]) 3. Audits: [StaFi rToken App Audits]([link]) 4. Centralization Vectors:StaFis rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stoppingJust that the bridge would run less efficiently. 5. Market History: rETH has been a tradable asset since March 2021. Trading has primarily taken place in the aforementioned rETH-ETH pool on Curve. FIS is a liquid asset traded both on top centralized exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges. 6. Value: StaFi will make its Balancer rETH-ETH pool a primary source of liquidity for rETH on Ethereum mainnet. By bolstering liquidity of the pool, Balancer should gain from increased trading fees.

409, [BIP-167] Fast Track Execution of BIP 159 & 160,"PR with payload: [link] Motivation. As part of the ongoing process to transition to the timelock authorizer the Maxis have temporarily lost the ability to add gauges the traditional way. Once the migration to the new authorizer and to the Gauge Adder v3 is complete then that ability will be restored. We're currently targeting the end of February for this to be done. Until then, any new gauge must be added by the DAO Multisig directly. BIP 159 & 160 were not written with the specification required to do this. After communicating with the teams involved they desire to proceed immediately with the adding of their gauges rather than waiting another month. This proposal will add their already approved gauges directly from the DAO Multisig. Its also important to note that once we trigger the next stage of the Gauge Adder v3 migration there will be a 14 day window where no new gauges can be added by any method. This is expected to begin on Feb 13th or so. Specification. 1.

Some permissions, like 'GaugeController.add_gauge', will be scheduled to be granted in the future due to existing delays. Everything has been verified and checked to ensure a smooth transition. However, some temporary permissions are not being transferred, including the root permission given to the GaugeAdderMigrationCoordinator. The final step involves making the migrator a granter over all permissions in all contracts, meaning it can restore old permissions and complete the migration. This needs to happen after the TimelockAuthorizer migration is done, as that ensures the governance multisig will be the root account of the new system.","The TransitionMigrator is a tool that will migrate permissions from a certain time period in the past to a future date. It has already been verified that all the necessary roles and permissions exist. However, some temporary permissions will not be re-granted. To complete the migration, the governance multisig needs to call a function on the TimelockAuthorizer using specific arguments. This will give the migrator the ability to re-grant the old permissions. Once the migration is finished, the migrator will give up this privilege. It's important to note that this step should only be done after the TimelockAuthorizer migration is complete, as otherwise the governance multisig won't have the necessary authority.","This proposal is about migrating permissions that were granted after the deployment of the TimelockAuthorizer in block 16085047, but before Jan 25th 2023 (block 16484500). These permissions have delays associated with them, so they need to be scheduled for future granting. The TransitionMigrator is an address that has been confirmed to grant these old and new permissions- the governance multisig will need to call 'manageGranter' on it at [hexadecimals], and pass in actionId and account with their corresponding values. Once this is done, the migrator will renounce its priviledge allowing it to re-grant all of these permissions.","TransitionMigrator migrates all permissions granted after the deployment of the TimelockAuthorizer (in block 16085047) until Jan 25th 2023 (block 16484500) Some of these permissions have delays, so these are instead scheduled to be granted in the future.

The team is coordinating efforts to represent Aavegotchi as a unit; collaborating by wearing weather-appropriate branded team gear, carrying physical merchandise such as stickers, boiling down concise explanations for specific target audiences, and distributing links to a landing page showcasing key features of the protocol and resources for builders. One IRL meetup we are excited to host is an ebic coffee shop live-streamed discussion featuring interesting builders present at the event, advocates from venues, and existing partnership connections. We are calling this event BuidlWithFrens. There will be merchandise giveaways and a custom FG card exclusive to the event, published by GMI. The event will be an opportunity to connect with new frens, and capture unique and interesting experiences from both the Hackathon, shilling zone, man-on-the-street interviews, as well as lectures workshops. The whole coffee shop event will be broadcasted via various streaming services, including Aavegotchi Discord for those who cannot attend. An extensive media plan has been put together for ETH Denver featuring a diverse and varied array of content, notably a dual daily VLOG, as well as raw footage sent to both editors and the Pixelcraft marketing team for promotional videos. Media coverage will not only increase our presence at the event, but also give the Aavegotchi team multiple opportunities to create long-term connections with other interesting and informed attendees. The Gotchi Lodge(Air BNB) is close to the venue, making it easy to host interviews there as well. Currently, lodging for the event has been secured close to the main venues. Travel plans to the event are secured for over-the-road travellers, with flyers waiting for proposal approval prior to ticket purchase. Details for the ETH Denver Core event are currently limited, but being followed closely with the guidance of LostLocal. The team is in process of procuring team gear and coordinating with partners such as the ETH Denver Polygon team for collaborative opportunities. ETH Denver BUIDLWeek kicks off February 24th and runs to March 1st. The Core event runs from March 2nd to March 5th. There is a Mountain retreat running from March 6th to the 9th. Attendance to the retreat costs extra, and many of our members have not opted in for this. No allocated proposal funding will be utilised for the optional Mountain Retreat.

418,[Ideation] SCP-128 - Enable opt-out donations instead of fees,"For more background and discussion, please see [[Incubation] Enable opt-out donations instead of fees]([link]) Summary. This proposal will grant authority to the leaders of the Product and Engineering Workstream to implement optional, opt-out donations for any features offered in the ShapeShift App. The optional donations will be clearly visible in the UI (not hidden), and users will have the option to save their preference on their device. As long as both the Product and Engineering workstream leader agree, they will have the power and flexibility to implement these donations however they determine is in the best interest of the DAO until this authority is revoked. Abstract. This proposal was created as a counter proposal to [Added fees for Thorchain swaps]([link]) Currently, ShapeShifts application ([link] or [link]) is an open-source public good that does not add any additional fees onto protocols or services that it integrates. As one alternative business model, the DAO has established affiliate revenue relationships with multiple partners including fiat on/off ramps, DEXs, Name services, Yield aggregators, swag stores, hardware wallets, and validator operators. Once ShapeShift finds product market fit and attracts more users, this model could enable ShapeShifts application to remain free forever and generate more than enough revenues to cover expenses and fund growth. ![No fees + FOX [image]]([link]) ""Free is a [powerful concept]([link]) in and of itself, and the community has the unique opportunity to take this one step further by not only not adding fees, but also sustainably rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO via their activities in the app with FOX tokens. This could be a disruptively powerful model that could make ShapeShift objectively the best way to use a growing number of crypto protocols and services. This is a model in which users would have to be crazy to not use ShapeShift. This is a model that makes me bullish on the ShapeShift communitys ability to buidl the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe and cultivate unstoppable/unforkable network effects. I talk about this model in depth in this presentation from ETHDenver 2021: [link] While the DAO is actively generating ~$10k/mo via the affiliate revenue model, current operating expenses are closer to $200k/mo, and the DAO is not profitable with current usage levels and market conditions. With the hope of extending runway and one day being profitable, a proposal has been made to experiment with adding fees onto protocols that ShapeShift integrates. While this proposal has positive intentions to increase the chances of ShapeShifts survival and success, multiple community members and contributors have expressed concerns that adding any fees could have the opposite effect. To summarize some of the arguments against the fee experiment: Fees alone are not a solution. Ultimately the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users, and fees make it more difficult to attract and retain users. An experiment is not needed to prove that users would prefer not to pay fees, and it will be difficult to draw any conclusive results from the experiment. If usage did increase with fees, how could one know how much usage there would be without fees? Pursuing grant funding for integrating features that are already aligned with the DAOs roadmap has the potential to generate far more revenue than fees during the bear market, and abandoning the no-fee public good model could arguably harm the DAOs grant-fundability. To summarize the arguments for no fees: There is no issue with the current business model. Fees or no fees, the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users. By remaining free (or even better, being free and rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX), the DAO has the greatest potential to not only survive the bear market, but thrive, and achieve the communitys vision of building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe. In addition to fees being a race to the bottom, ShapeShifts application is entirely open-source. If the DAO did manage to achieve product market fit, it would be very easy and compelling for a single engineer to fork ShapeShift, launch their own governance token, and pursue the no fees + governance token reward strategy. If someone did this, their offering would be objectively better, and ShapeShift would be at a risk of a vampire attack, similar to when SushiSwap forked Uniswap and sucked out the majority of their TVL in the course of 1 week with minimal effort. This risk is not a fantasy, but the status quo; whenever any open-source protocol in Web3 realizes product market fit, these forks should be expected. With opt-out fees, the DAO would be in a better position to defend against this attack vector. The DAO has not yet attempted the no fee + FOX reward model, largely because it spent the first 1.5 years of its existence focused on rebuilding/open-sourcing the legacy application and architecting it for full decentralization. Before throwing in the towel and adding fees on top of decentralized protocols, the DAO should experiment with rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX tokens. Through the lively community debate(s) on whether or not to experiment with adding fees, a new idea emerged (h/t @graymachine and @hornyfox) to implement optional, opt-out donations. This is the same model that both Giveth and Gitcoin have implemented that enables them to generate revenue and build network effects without mandatory fees, arguably much more than they would generate with fees. For such a controversial, divisive topic, I see this proposal as a solid middle ground which satisfies many of both camps' desires while also alleviating many of their concerns. ![Optional donations - [image]]([link]) Motivation More valuable data: The data ShapeShift will get from whether or not users are opting-out of fees will give a good idea as to how much users really care about fees. On the other hand, if ShapeShift simply enables fees on THORChain swaps as currently proposed, it will be difficult to draw any conclusions. More public goodness - ShapeShift can remain a free, open-source public good, which is a powerful meme, particularly in Web3, and particularly as a community-owned DAO. It also doesn't require updating existing marketing messaging, and mitigates the risk of upsetting community members or users that were promised no fees forever.' More revenues: The opt-out approach has the potential to generate more revenues than mandatory fees, while also alienating fewer users. Further, this proposal grants authority to add opt-out donations to more features than just THORChain swaps, and also doesn't require removing existing affiliate revenue streams. If this proposal passes, ShapeShift could potentially offer opt-out donations, still generate affiliate revenues, and reward users that generate revenue for the DAO with FOX. Remaining as a public good could also support the DAOs efforts to continue securing grants. Less fees: Another motivation for this proposal is to offer a compelling alternative to adding mandatory fees and to buy time for the community to experiment with the no fees + FOX rewards model. Specification. The optional donations should be implemented in a way such that the donation amount is clear/not hidden, users can easily opt-out of donating, users can save their preference to opt-out locally on their devices, and no additional transactions are required from the user. This proposal is purposefully left vague to give flexibility to the Product and Engineering workstreams to implement the optional donations on whichever features and in whichever way they best see fit. Both the product (Diggy) and engineering ([hexadecimals]) workstream leaders expressed in the Incubation post that they are not worried about the lift nor UX implications and that if this proposal were to pass, their workstreams would do the necessary work. Benefits. 1. Increase revenues and runway. 2. Maximize user growth and retention/minimize user friction. 3. Maximize grant-fundability. 4. Maintain value prop of ""free, public good status, and meme-power. 5. Buy time to experiment with no fees + FOX rewards, which could help the DAO in achieving strong and defensible product market fit. Drawbacks. 1. Even though donations are optional, they could add a slight amount of friction to the UX relative to the current status quo of no fees nor opt-out donations. 2. Its possible that optional donations would result in less revenues than mandatory fees. 3. Mandatory fees would not be added to THORChain swaps, and the DAO would not be able to see the results of that fee experiment unless another proposal was passed in the future.

441,[BIP-170] Enable PENDLE-ETH (50/50) Gauge with a 2% cap [Ethereum],"[PR with multisig payload]([link]) Authors. Pendle Finance, with support from Aura contributors. Summary. Pendle is proposing to enable a Balancer gauge for a PENDLE-ETH pool on mainnet with a 2% emissions cap. Protocol Description. The Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via the custom V2 AMM. This brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. PT is the equivalent of [zero-coupon bonds]([link]) while YT is the equivalent of [coupon payments]([link]) By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as: Long assets at a discount Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral A mix of any of the above strategies. Utility. PENDLE is the platform token of the Pendle protocol and is the cornerstone of value accrual mechanics and management. It also functions as the governance token, by staking and locking into vePENDLE. With vePENDLE, an array of new features are unlocked for PENDLE holders, increasing the tokens utility. The Pendle protocol collects a 3% fee from all yield accrued by yield tokens (YT) and 80% of the swap fees(0.1% of the trade at a 1 year maturity) in the V2 AMM. Currently, 100% of this fee is distributed to vePENDLE holders, while the contributors collect no revenue. This is subject to change in the future. A portion of the yield from matured unredeemed PTs will be distributed pro rata to vePENDLE holders as well. If you LP in a pool while you are holding vePENDLE, your PENDLE incentives and rewards for all of your LPs will be further boosted as well, by up to 2.5x based on your vePENDLE value. The Pendle protocol is currently deployed on Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of deploying the protocol on other EVM chains. Recently, Pendle launched a v2 AMM which made several improvements to the protocol: increased capital efficiency with more LP revenue sources and trading, specialized yield trading with concentrated liquidity and optimized fee rate, and minimal impermanent loss with no value leakage from arbitrage. In addition, with the v2 launch, the protocol is now fully permissionless wherein anyone can list and create a market for any yield-bearing asset. PENDLE distribution. As of October 2022: 10% Incentives 19.2% Ecosystem Fund 5.7% Team (Vested) 65.1% Circulating Total: 235,890,444 PENDLE. Team tokens vest up to April 2023. Beyond this, any increase in circulating supply will be contributed by incentives and ecosystem building. Emissions as of Oct 2022 are 667,705 PENDLE per week, with a 1.1% decrease each week until April 2026. At this point, the current tokenomics allow for a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum for incentives. ![[image]]([link]) As the industry matures, governance may propose changes based on the evolution of ecosystem best practices. ![[image]]([link]) Motivation. Pendle currently has ~$545.08K on Sushi and ~199.3K on Kyber in trading volume over the last 30 days. Most of the current PENDLE liquidity resides in the form of a PENDLE-wETH pool with liquidity currently valued at $873.5K. Pendle Finance would like to deepen the liquidity for the PENDLE token on Ethereum to support low slippage transactions. Furthermore, Pendle intends to provide voting incentives to the pool via Hidden Hand, namely through the vlAURA market. Pendle is aiming at incentivizing votes with approximately $8,000 worth of PENDLE per vlAURA voting cycle (every two weeks) Lastly, Pendle would like to be a part of the continued growth that Balancer has been experiencing and to capture the upside of what is to come to the Balancer DEX (e.g. technology, partnerships, integrations) Specifications Governance: Pendles governance is powered by Vote-Escrowed PENDLE, or vePENDLE. vePENDLE enables protocol governance by allowing PENDLE holders to channel protocol incentives to desired pools. Oracles: The PENDLE token does not use any oracles. Audits: The Pendle codebase has been fully audited by reputable auditors, including some of the top wardens from C4, and all flaws have been addressed. Nonetheless, users are advised to exercise caution and deploy funds prudently. [link] Centralization Vectors: The core protocol is designed to be decentralized and permissionless. Protocol assets are only accessible by the users and not by any other entities. There is a governance role (currently a multisig) that could set the protocol fees, which have a hard cap set in smart contracts. The PENDLE token is not upgradeable, pausable, and does not have any blacklisting capabilities. Market History: PENDLE has been live since April 2021 on Ethereum. Sushi Pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Kyber Pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Value: Upon approval, this gauge will be the primary liquidity pool for PENDLE on Ethereum and drive value to Balancer through trading volume and rewards via bribes.

465,AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool,"Hello, This is a vote for AIP - 49 to launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

466,AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD,"Hello, This is a vote for AIP - 48 to seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve.

The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

The ultimate goal is to facilitate easy, fee-less transitions and trades involving agGOLD and other associated stablecoin, thus leading to robust use cases and showcasing the protocol's expertise in stablecoin operations.
","This proposal involves a series of votes to launch agGOLD, a stablecoin backed by gold, on the Angle protocol. The first vote decides on the collateral assets for agGOLD, which will be ETH, wstETH, and USDC. The second vote involves swapping USDC for PAXG to add liquidity to a Curve pool. The third vote aims to automate the process of minting agGOLD using the Curve pool. The fourth vote proposes creating a Uniswap V3 pool for agGOLD and agEUR with a 0.3% fee. The fifth vote suggests launching a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool to receive a portion of the ANGLE inflation. The final vote is to enable free flash-loans for agGOLD. These votes aim to deploy and establish agGOLD while minimizing costs and providing useful features for users. The options for voting are to either launch the gauge or do nothing.",This proposal is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of an Angle Gold stablecoin. The proposal is to launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive part of the ANGLE inflation. This is intended to provide incentives to agGOLD holders and boost liquidity in the pool.,"This is a vote for AIP - 51 to launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive part of the ANGLE inflation. This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of an Angle Gold stablecoin. The Angle protocol was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. The protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boost liquidity in some places. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. Proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and X AU/ETH. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address. AIP-49 would create an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGolds in the pool. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGold-PAXG pool to be created upon agGgold deployment. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. It makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. AgEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. The intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. Proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3] that maximizes efficiency given to liquidity providers. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and is already in use for agEUR.  agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. There will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR.  agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol"

497,[ARFC] MaticX Risk Parameter Interest Rate Polygon v3 Upgrade,"title: [ARFC] MaticX Risk Parameter Interest Rate Polygon v3 Upgrade. discussion: [link] shortDescription: Update the MaticX reserve on Polygon v3 to enable borrowing, introduce a BorrowCap and increase the SupplyCap. author:[Llama]([link]) [DeFi_Consulting]([link]) [scottincrypto]([link]) & [efecarranza]([link]) created: 2023-02-16. Summary. Llama with support from Gauntlet proposes upgrading the MaticX Reserve on Polygon to facilitate an expansion of the MaticX/wMATIC loop strategy with the introduction of rewards. Abstract. The utilisation of the MaticX reserve has been trending higher over time and with the introduction of deposit rewards, there is an expectation the SupplyCap will be reached prohibiting additional MaticX from being deposited. Increasing the SupplyCap enables the recursive MaticX/wMATIC strategy to grow beyond the current constraints. Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. This proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. Motivation. Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products.

511,Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V3 Avalanche - 2023.02.07 ,"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Avalanche assets. Motivation. Chaos Labs' Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different configurations of Aave V3 risk parameters would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. Note: As a general guideline, we limit the search range to 3% change for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal.

512,[ARFC] Freeze BUSD on Aave V2,"title: [ARFC] Freeze BUSD on Aave V2. Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-02-13. Summary. Following the recent developments between Paxos (minter of BUSD) and the SEC, Paxos will stop minting BUSD From the 21st of February 2023, and will only allow redemption for their underlying value by burning BUSD. The circulating supply of BUSD will thus trend toward zero over time. This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to freeze BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Abstract. This ARFC proposes to freeze the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Motivation. While BUSD is not an asset with borrowing power, and recent development does not present risks of excess debt, From the 21st of February 2023, the circulating supply of this asset will eventually go toward zero. As theres no real prospect of growth and the inability to mint new BUSD might hurt peg arbitrage opportunity and asset peg. It seems that the most reasonable path for Aave is to freeze this reserve and invite users to switch to another stablecoin among the diversity present in Aave. As theres no immediate risk for the protocol, the ACI doesn't call for a fast-track process for this ARFC, and the standard governance process seems fit. Specification.

This proposal suggests that Aave, a crypto protocol, should 'freeze' any BUSD within its system, meaning it will not use or trade it anymore because its value and availability could become unreliable. The proposal isn't something that has to be done urgently, but it's suggested as a sensible idea and encourages users to choose a different stablecoin (a crypto coin with stable value).
","This proposal suggests freezing the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. This is because Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, will stop creating new BUSD and only allow redemption, causing the circulating supply of BUSD to decrease over time.

519,Introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program,"Note: This is a signal to dYdX Trading to implement the proposed changes. The dYdX Community has no power over trading fees. Summary: As part of our [V4 Vanguard Post]([link]), we are proposing to introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program. As we begin to think about the sustainability of V4, its important to reduce the reliance on LP rewards and incentivize liquidity in a natural way. Proposed Changes: Introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program: ![image]([link]) Description: A large proponent of dYdXs overall sustainability is retaining liquidity providers and traders. If we assume DYDX rewards are non-existent, how do we incentivize liquidity providers? Compared to its competitors, dYdX lacks a separate Market-Making Fee Program. This is arguably a result of the LP rewards program. However, as the number of markets, products, and competitors increases, the average reward per MM is expected to decrease with a fixed reward pool. Therefore, its imperative for dYdX to introduce a Market-Making Fee Program with rebates to naturally incentivize liquidity and reduce the reliance on rewards. The proposed Market-Making Fee Program as shown in Figure 5 consists of 5 tiers based on maker volume as a % of the 30D exchange volume on dYdX. Such a program with these proposed fee tiers is standard across most top-tier CEXs. As a result, MMs rewards are directly proportional to their maker volume and not bound by the size of the reward pool. Furthermore, by introducing a Market-Making Fee Program: MMs become more inelastic to changes in the current rewards program given rebates are more predictable and their reward surplus is now larger than before. The protocol now has a way to naturally incentivize liquidity, providing increased freedom when altering DYDX rewards. The protocol is no longer constrained by an increasing number of markets that are expected in V4. Obvious liquidity improvements by incentivizing maker volume. Should dYdX Trading implement a Market Maker Rebate Program?",The text is proposing that dYdX Trading implement a Market Maker Rebate Program. This program would involve creating tiers based on maker volume as a percentage of the 30-day exchange volume on dYdX. The goal of this program is to incentivize liquidity providers and reduce the reliance on LP rewards while also providing more predictable reward structures for market makers.,The text is proposing that dYdX Trading implement a Market Maker Rebate Program. This program would involve creating tiers based on maker volume as a percentage of the 30-day exchange volume on dYdX. The goal of this program is to incentivize liquidity providers and reduce the reliance on LP rewards while also providing more predictable reward structures for market makers.,"We're suggesting that dYdX Trading should consider creating a Market Maker (MM) Rebate Program. This creates a natural incentive for liquidity providers, lowering the dependence on liquidity provider rewards. As more markets and products emerge, the average payoff per market maker may reduce. Currently, dYdX doesn't have a separate Market-Making Fee Program, making it less competitive. By introducing a Market-Making Fee Program based on the volume contributed, more rewards are given directly based on volume and not by the reward pool size. This can also pave way for natural liquidity incentive and help improve obvious liquidity by encouraging more volume. The goal here is to convince dYdX to consider implementing this plan.","The proposal is to introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program on dYdX Trading as part of their V4 update. This program aims to incentivize liquidity providers in a natural way and reduce reliance on LP rewards. Currently, dYdX lacks a separate Market-Making Fee Program, which affects their ability to retain liquidity providers compared to competitors. By implementing this program with different fee tiers based on maker volume, dYdX can reward liquidity providers based on their trading activity rather than a fixed reward pool. This will make liquidity providers less dependent on the current rewards program, allow more flexibility in adjusting rewards, and drive liquidity improvements.","The proposal is to introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program as part of the [V4 Vanguard Post]([link]) It is intended to incentivize liquidity providers in a natural way and reduce reliance on LP rewards by offering MMs (market makers) rewards that are directly proportional to their maker volume, rather than being bound by a fixed reward pool.","As part of our [V4 Vanguard Post], we are proposing to introduce a Market Maker Rebate Program.

520,[ARC] Gauntlet Risk Parameter Updates for Optimism Aave V3 (2023-02-16),"Simple Summary. Gauntlets risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify liquidation bonus on two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets without adding outsized market risk. Additionally, we provide user position analysis below. Abstract. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

529,[FIP - 187] Implementation of a ragequit function FRAX/mUSD (8% /year),"Author. WhiteWidow. Proposal. I propose the implementation of a ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital.

548,AIP - 54: Add a Timelock contract to the governance multisig across all chains,"This is a vote to add a Timelock contract to the protocol across the different chains on which the governance of the protocol is deployed. Transactions issued by the governance multisig of the protocol would need 48 hours before being finally executable. Context. Angle Protocol is governed by veANGLE holders who vote on Snapshot for protocol improvement decisions. Finalized votes are then implemented by a 4/6 multi-sig composed of community members. This multisig, deployed on all chains where the protocol is live natively, has the ownership on many of the smart contracts of the protocol. Proposal. Proposal is to give ownership across all the contracts of the protocol to the Timelock contract, and make the owner of this Timelock contract the existing 4/6 governance multisig. The way future proposals would be executed with this setup is the following: 1. Vote happens on Snapshot. 2. If good on Snapshot, the transaction payload is sent to the Timelock contract by the 4/6 governance multisig (which is the only address able to queue payloads to the system) 3. Once the timelock delay is over, anyone can execute the transaction. We propose as such to set the delay to 48 hours. Implementation. Implementation suggested for the Timelock contract is that of OpenZeppelin 'TimelockControllerUpgradeable' It will be first set so that only the governance multisig can add payloads to the timelock. In the first place, no one will have the possibility to cancel transactions except this governance multisig. This role could be granted to other specific contracts in the future (to implement Optimistic approval type of mechanisms) Value to the protocol. The advantage of having a timelock is that leaves anyone the opportunity to take actions in case of a wrongdoing of the multisig. Should you see that the multisig has implemented a transaction to pull funds from the protocol (regardless of what has been voted on Snapshot), then you'll be able to withdraw your funds before the transaction is finally executed. Risks. The only risk with a timelock is that it reduces the delay for operational responses with the protocol if there is an issue that cannot be addressed by the guardian multisig. Voting Options. 1. For, add timelock. 2. Against, do nothing","The proposal is about adding a Timelock contract to the Angle Protocol governance. This means that any transactions issued by the protocol's multisig would need 48 hours before being fully executed and finalized. The Timelock contract will be owned by the existing 4/6 governance multisig, so only they can add payloads and execute transactions.

The power to start this process rests with the current administrators. This allows everyone to have some time to react if they feel something is not right about the change.

564,[BIP-200] Enable veLIT Gauge on Ethereum w/2% emissions cap,"[PR with multisig payload]([link]) Summary: Proposal to add a gauge for Timeless' veLIT token on Ethereum, one of the first ve8020 based on the popular veBAL model. This proposal is a first step aiming to align with the key strategic objective of Balancer, described in the [[BIP-146]]([link]) References/Useful links: Timeless Webapp: [link] Docs: [link] Blog: [link] Bunni Webapp: [link] Twitter: [link] Forum: [link] Snapshot: [link] Github: [link] 80LIT/20ETH pool: [link] LIT token address: [link] veLIT token address: [link] Governance Multisig: [link] DefiLlama: [link] & [link] Description: veLIT stands for vote-escrowed Liquidity Incentive Token, it is simply LIT locked for a period of time. veLIT is the core component of Timeless' liquidity engine, [Bunni.pro]([link]) This engine is designed to maximize liquidity on Uniswap v3 by creating complex incentivization schemes. Timeless hopes that by launching LIT, other projects will be able to incentivize their token liquidity at a much higher level of efficiency on Uni v3. Additionally, Timeless use LIT and Bunni to bootstrap liquidity in its own yield token markets. How does Timeless work? Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol. You can provide assets to Timeless (e.g. 100 USDC) and mint PYT and NYT (e.g. 100 PYT and 100 NYT) The assets will be deposited into a farm, and the yield earned can be claimed by the PYT holders. By holding either only PYT or only NYT, you can build either a long position or short position on yield rates such as stETH or aUSDC. How does Bunni work? Bunni is a liquidity engine that was built on top of Uniswap v3. It was initially released in October 2022 as a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Curve and Balancer. These improvements aim to: - Encourage the longevity of the protocol by disincentivizing farming-and-dumping and aligning the interests of liquidity providers and LIT holders. - Provide the protocol with a large treasury to fund growth and reduce LIT price volatility. - Maintain a high level of liquidity for LIT. For more information about the tokenomics, please see FOO: Fungible Ownership Optimization:' [link] Motivation: Timeless is a steadfast advocate of Balancer technology and will maintain its utilization in the long term. By incorporating a veLIT gauge, Balancer highlights the capabilities of the ve8020 model to a wide array of DeFi projects considering their tokenomics strategy. If LIT succeeds in becoming the CRV of Uni v3, both Timeless and Balancer will reap the benefits. This mutually beneficial outcome increases visibility for our respective ecosystems. The potential increase in liquidity, trades, and fees generated by the 80/20 LIT/WETH pool could result in significant revenue for the Balancer protocol and its LPs. Specifications: 1.

As Timeless and Bunni grow their users base, Balancer will directly profit from this with increased fees through the usage of veLIT and its underlying 8020 LIT/WETH pool. Specification. 1.

571,[FIP - 195] Move Locks Back to 3 Years for 3x Boost,"Author. Nader Ghazvini. Summary. This proposal aims to move the maximum lock time for all new gauges back to three years for a 3x boost on the Frax Finance protocol. Background and Motivations. Currently, Frax Finance offers users the option to lock their tokens for one year in exchange for a 2x boost. However, this option has not proven more effective than the previous option of locking tokens for three years for a 3x boost. Therefore, we propose to move the lock option back to three years for a 3x boost. This change will only apply to FRAXOHM, clevUSD, msUSD, and future gauges, and the gauges deployed with a maximum one-year lock and 2x boost won't be unlocked or redeployed. By moving the lock option back to three years, we hope to achieve the following goals: Encourage users to lock their tokens for a longer period, resulting in increased liquidity, trading volumes, protocol stability, and anti-reflexivity in the stablecoin peg. Provide users with a more attractive incentive to lock their tokens, improving the platforms overall performance. Increase user participation and engagement on the platform by giving them more flexibility and control over their tokens.

Right now, users can lock their tokens for a year, which gives them a 2x boost. But, this hasn't been as effective as locking them for three years for a 3x boost. So, Nader thinks we should go back to the three-year lock option for certain tokens. This wouldn't affect tokens already locked for one year. The goal here is to get more users to commit their tokens for longer, as it could improve stability, trading volumes, and rewards. Users are being asked to vote either for returning to the three-year lock and 3x boost or to keep things as they are.

582,Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V3 Arbitrum - 2023.02.20,"Simple Summary. A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Arbitrum assets. Motivation. Chaos Labs' Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range. Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here]([link]) You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this[page]([link]) The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Arbitrum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$510,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.25.49 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.14 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.25 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.36 AM (1)png]([link]) Liquidity and Position Analysis: Generally, the TVL in Aave on Arbitrum (98M$) compared to the overall chain trading volume (~$142M /daily over the past three months) should allow on-chain liquidity sources to absorb liquidations across the Arbitrum positions. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.50.40 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.51.28 AM (1)png]([link]) Source: [DeFiLlama]([link]) As a result, Aave protocol on Arbitrum is expected to experience very low bad debt, even in extreme market conditions, across most assets. Specifically, the current values of LT and LTV for multiple assets can be safely increased to improve capital efficiency at a very low or no additional bad debt risk due to price volatility.

593,A proposal for partnering with Nethermind to design a mechanism for a good validator set maintenance. Phase II.,"TL;DR. This a proposal to fund Nethermind to design white-labeling resistance mechanism. The delivery will include a detailed discussion of the final design and a systematization of knowledge for white-labeling prevention, oracle systems, prediction markets, and token-curated assets. During the project, a team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is, what solutions are or will be used in practice, and how. Then we will propose concrete mechanisms to make Lidos network white-labeling resistant. The project will be one of the steps toward enabling Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. This is a continuation of[the previous proposal]([link]) The project will take 22 weeks, and its cost  450 000 DAI  will be covered by Lido DAO. Proposer and work mindset. Proposer. Michał Zając on behalf of Nethermind. About Nethermind. Nethermind is a team of world-class builders and researchers with expertise across several domains: Ethereum Protocol Engineering, Cryptography Research, Layer-2s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Miner Extractable Value (MEV), Smart Contract Development, Security Auditing, and Formal Verification, among others. Our Research team comprises computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers who work on analyzing, breaking, and designing blockchain and cryptographic schemes. Our expertise and interests span the fields of[zero-knowledge]([link])proofs, non-deterministic programming,[Distributed Validator Technology]([link]), and[decentralized identity]([link]) Working to solve some of the most challenging problems in the blockchain space, we frequently collaborate with renowned companies and DAOs, such as Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Lido Finance, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Flashbots, xDai, Open Zeppelin, Forta Protocol, Energy Web, POA Network and many more. We actively contribute to Ethereum core research and development, EIPs, and network upgrades with the Ethereum Foundation and other client teams. General work mindset. The following principles will drive the development of the protocols: - All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO. - All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols' security will be proven. - Milestones and deliverables will be small to ensure a good overview of the teams progress. Ideal mechanism overview. An ideal mechanism evaluates Lidos DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in[this note]([link]) by Lido. More precisely, the mechanism must have methods for improving the validator set if there is an option to do so. It must have zero input from permissioned roles (i.e., no admins/committees) Furthermore, it must have an input of low to zero impact from LDO, stETH, and ETH token holders. General objectives. We will assist Lido in creating and maintaining a permissionless and high-quality validator set mechanism. This entails: 1. Designing and implementing methods to ensure that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e., it does not hire a white-label operator), nor is secretly associated with other operators, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly. 2. Conducting a thorough economic analysis to understand how the market fluctuations, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can compromise the systems security. The project will be divided into following phases: - Phase 1:We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. This phase has been completed[already]([link]) - Phase 2:During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to white-labeling-protection. We will focus on arbiter protocols: oracles and prediction markets, to assess they usability in this problem. Then we will propose a mechanism that utilize an arbiter protocol to fight white-labeling. We will also investigate how to disincentivize using white labeling operators. The present proposal focuses solely on this phase. - Phase 2.5:We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the white-labeling prevention mechanism designed in Phase 2. - Phase 3:During this phase we will work on the Sybil resistance. We will prepare a survey on the state-of-the-art approaches and propose a mechanism that significantly increases the cost of creating Sybils. - Phase 3.5We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the Sybil prevention mechanism designed in Phase 3. - Phase 4: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1 to 4. - Phase 5:This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during the previous phases. We will also research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3. Project Objective. Phase 2. White-labeling resistance mechanism design. In this part of the project, we will focus on one of the crucial aspects of the security of a permissionless staking protocol. Namely ensuring that operators perform their duties independently and don't use third parties, so-called white-label operators, to do them on their behalf. An entity that runs multiple operators (whether by controlling Sybils or being a white-label operator) could have too much control over stake, and the protocol in general. This would worsen the overall health of the protocol, weaken its resistance against correlated slashing, and could introduce a single point of failure. We emphasize that even if we ensure that all onboarding operators are honest, we still need to have a system that detects dishonest parties within the set of already onboarded operators. This is because white-label operators can be created among the onboarded operators, even if these operators honestly entered the system. The latter may happen, e.g., when one entity that runs operators buys another that also runs operators. In that case, the buying party may end up controlling too much of the stake. Our work plan for developing the white-labeling resistance will begin by researching several techniques that, we believe, have the potential to lead to a solution in isolation or as part of an amalgam. The different types of methods we will explore are listed below. In particular, we will investigate arbiter protocols. The motivation for using arbiter protocols is following  a party that suspects that some operator is a white label could raise that issue and make a corresponding prediction market where people can bet on whether they believe in the claim. Then the conflict would be resolved by an assigned resolution mechanism. The final goal of our work will be to produce a report explaining exactly how the Lido network can use such methods. TASK 1White-labeling resistance. SoK. We will begin with supplementing the SoK from Phase 1 with an SoK for white-labeling resistance. We will look for such mechanisms used not only in Web3 but also in Web2 and, if necessary, real life. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 2 Arbiter protocols. SoK. We expect some core components to be decentralized oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets (with the focus on the last one) We will use these ""arbiter protocols, as we call them, to assess whether. - a prospective operator will provide good quality services and contribute to the quality of the operators' set or. - an already onboarded operator uses a white-label operator. As a first step, we will prepare an SoK for the following topics: - decentralized oracles. - prediction markets. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 3 Arbiter protocols. Resolution mechanisms. In this part, we will design a mechanism that resolves disputes in arbiter protocols. We will propose concrete setups for decentralized oracles and prediction markets. We will specify which parties make the oracle and who resolves disputes in prediction markets. We will analyze the feasibility of using already onboarded operators as part of an oracle system. Similarly, we will also explore the idea of using LDO holders as a resolution mechanism for prediction markets and oracles. To protect operators from being unjustly accused, we will design a mechanism that allows such operators to raise a flag and notify the DAO of the resolution mechanisms wrongdoing. This part will take 8 weeks. TASK 4 Heuristics against Sybils and white-labels. We will analyze the possibility of using heuristic mechanisms to detect Sybils and white labels by analyzing their behavior and setups. We will analyze the available literature on the topic and determine operators and the parameters that should be observed. Finally, we will draft a mechanism that, in conjunction with the arbiter protocol, could be used to detect Sybilling or white-labeling operator.This part will take 4 weeks. TASK 5 Do you trust your white-label? We will investigate a mechanism that will require from parties using white-label operators to trust them with some funds. More precisely, in the mechanism the party joining Lido will need to put some collateral that can be transferred using validators key. Hence, the collateral could be efficiently stolen by the white-labeling party that keeps the key. This part will take 2 weeks. On implementation This phase does not contain implementation. This is since at this stage of research it is impossible to tell what should be implemented, how, and how long would it take. We will propose a proof-of-concept implementation for one of the solutions designed in TASK 4 or 5. We will submit a separate proposal for the implementation effort as soon as possible. This phase will be completed within 22 weeks from the date of the agreement. This phase does not contain any implementation. Organization, Funding, and Budget. The project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 450 000 DAI, of which 200 000 DAI will be paid upfront and the remaining 250 000 DAI on delivery. At the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment.

603,Securing Protocol Rewards – Operational & funding request,"Author: AL 4105. Gotchi ID: (10504) Securing Protocol Rewards  Operational & funding request. Sigprop summary (important parts): Buyback schedule specifications for buying $GHST protocol rewards outlined in AGIP65. This includes consideration of a non-linear 18-month buying schedule with a 2-month long multiplier for purchase amounts to coincide with the liquidity mining plan, and the funding of an automated smart contract to execute purchases with various features. More details below: INTRO. Per AGIP65 25% of the unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve are supposed to be allocated for securing protocol rewards in the form of rarity farming rewards. To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request. 1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program: The main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO. Filling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases. For voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards. It is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program. 2) Smart Contract. The proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST. This proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production. The expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users: - Gelato automation tooling. - Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery. - Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks. - Toggling for slippage rate tolerance. - Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase. + potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities. Funding Request: We are seeking a separate request of $5000 DAI (or $5000 worth of $GHST) to complete this contract as it will require ongoing maintenance and wasn't anticipated in AGIP66 when the team was funded to conduct market research mainly.","This proposal is about setting up a system for the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to buy $GHST rewards with the 25% unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve.

608,[HIP-22] Reopen HOP airdrop claim window,"Authors: @max-andrew. Status: Snapshot-only vote. Date Posted: 2023-02-19 Summary: This proposal would create a new 60 day window for early Discord and Twitter users to submit claims for the airdrop. [The possibility of this extension is included in the original specifications of the airdrop.]([link]) This proposal would similarly include those who missed the Authereum claim window. Rationale: This proposal would include those who already qualified for the airdrop but were unable to submit their address before the deadline. This token distribution has already been accounted for and would entail minimal labor cost. Importantly, it would demonstrate Hop to be a DAO that is flexible and supports the users that support it. Specification: Reopen a 60 day claim period for early Discord, Twitter, and Authereum users who have already qualified for the airdrop Window will be reopened following a successful vote and two actions by the Hop team. An update to pre-existing forms ([link] [link]) to allow new submissions. An announcement made through social media to notify users of the reopening A delegate volunteer will privately validate the addresses submitted A list of valid addresses will be sent to the multisig for transfers to be processed using funds already allocated to it that will be reimbursed through the standard refill process Airdrop amounts will be calculated using the pre-existing formula The new airdrop will be sent within 14 days following the end of the 60-day period This proposal does not reclaim any HOP that might still remain to the treasury and does not rule out the possibility for reopening the reclaim window through future governance actions.","The proposal is about creating a 60-day window for early Discord, Twitter, and Authereum users to submit claims for the airdrop.

609,[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Avalanche ,"We [Blockchain at Michigan]([link]) are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated]([link]) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1sand not just on Ethereum L2sis vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanches growing ecosystem. Proposal Motivation. The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M]([link]) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market. We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment]([link]), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system]([link]), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the futurebut for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution. Current State of Avalanche. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanches security. Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators' transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes) Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platforms [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32]([link])surpassing most other L1sand is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators]([link]) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked]([link]) The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1. The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereums L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security) Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnets validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network. Increased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama]([link]), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols. Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanches txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M]([link]) Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%]([link]) Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022]([link]), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust. Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM]([link]), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanches DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswaps dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible. Due to Uniswaps strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanchealthough Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providersand maybe token holderswill attain economic value from the protocols increased usage. Safety and Cross-Chain Governance. LayerZero Overview. We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum. The [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer]([link]) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passingwhich includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche. LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous othersit is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocols novel Ultra Light Node (ULN) Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlinksince they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity. LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZeros infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren't prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormholes $300M and Nomads $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs' future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times]([link]) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team. LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M]([link]) Future Bridge Alterations. Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setupbut that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the ""[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script]([link]) LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. Timeline. Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.","This proposal is about submitting a request to initiate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on the Avalanche blockchain. The urgency for this proposal is due to the upcoming expiration of Uniswaps' Blockstreet Laboratories (BSL) License, which will allow entities to freely duplicate and utilize the code for commercial purposes. Therefore, it is important that Uniswap expands onto Avalanche before its competitors do in order to capture market share and create a robust multichain future. This particular deployment plans on utilizing LayerZero's omnichain bridging solution as opposed to Wormhole, which was used during the BNB Chain deployment - proposing instead that no single bridge should be set as precedent but rather multiple bridges should be tested out simultaneously in order to improve security measures and decentralization efforts. Additionally, safety precautions such as an Additional Use Grant via ENS domain uniswap.eth are suggested so that layer 1 Ethereum Governance still holds control over any such deployments on alternative chains like Avalanche.","This proposal is about submitting a request to initiate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on the Avalanche blockchain.

616,AIP - 56: Increase the quorum for the votes on the Snapshot space,"This is a proposal to increase the quorum on the Angle Snapshot space to 10% of the veANGLE. supply. Context. Right now the quorum on Angle Snapshot space is 1000 veANGLE. This means that unnoticed proposals created and voted by addresses with less than 0.01% of the total voting power could pass. On governance proposals created on Angle Snapshot space, usually StakeDAO liquid locker is also voting which means that there should be no issue of quorum whatsoever (as StakeDAO controls 50% of the veANGLE supply) Yet, if StakeDAO was to put a quorum on its space, then there may be situations where StakeDAO is not voting on Angle space and the quorum on Angle space is effective. Proposal. This is a proposal to add a quorum to Angle Snapshot space such that governance votes created on the space are only effective if 10% of the total veANGLE supply at the time at which the vote is created actually votes for the proposal. Implementation. Right now, its not possible to update automatically the quorum based on dynamic values on Snapshot. The way this would be implemented is that the addresses controlling the space would manually and regularly update the quorum to make it match to 10% of the veANGLE supply. Value to the protocol. Having a quorum reduces the risks of having addresses with a very small amount of the total supply taking decisions on behalf of all the other veANGLE holders. This is what happened (on StakeDAO Snapshot space though) for the vote to add a timelock. Only one address with 2m sdANGLE voted on StakeDAO and its vote resulted in 56m veANGLE voting no against the proposal. If there had been a quorum on StakeDAO, the influence of this single address would have smaller relative to its actual weight, and most of all, the vote on Angle Snapshot space would have been given up because of quorum reasons. Here the output of the Timelock vote is mostly that one community member was against, not that there was a majority of the community against it. A quorum on Angle Snapshot space (if coupled with a quorum on StakeDAO space) is a way to ensure that proposals taken by the Angle protocol are considered by a significant portion of the DAO participants, and that no proposals are voted for and or against without the intervention of a big amount of stakeholders. Risks. The main risk with a quorum that is too high is that it may paralyze the state of the protocol, with no proposals being actually implementable. Here the threshold of 10% is chosen so as to limit this risk. Since it implies no off-chain action, quorum decisions could easily be reverted as well. Voting Options. 1. For, increase quorum. 2. Against, do nothing","This proposal suggests increasing the quorum on Angle Snapshot space from 1000 veANGLE to 10% of the total veANGLE supply.

The main risk with having a quorum too high is paralyzing decision making in the DAO, so 10% was chosen as a balance between security and efficiency.

Two voting options are, for increasing the quorum or against doing anything.","This proposal suggests increasing the quorum on the Angle Snapshot space to 10% of the veANGLE supply.

The proposed quorum of 10% has been chosen to mitigate the risk of paralyzing the protocol while still ensuring a higher level of participation. The voting options are to either support the increase in quorum or to maintain the current quorum.","This proposal is to increase the minimum number of votes (also known as the ""quorum"") needed to pass a governance proposal on Angle Snapshot space from 1000 veANGLE to 10% of the total supply. The value of this is that it would reduce the risk of proposals being passed by addresses with very little voting power, and ensure that a significant portion of the DAO participants needs to vote in favor for any proposal to be implemented. The main risk is that it may paralyze the state of the protocol with no proposals being implementable, so a threshold of 10% is chosen to limit this risk. The two voting options are 1. For, increase quorum and 2. Against, do nothing","Right now the quorum on Angle Snapshot space is 1000 veANGLE. This means that unnoticed proposals created and voted by addresses with less than 0.01% of the total voting power could pass. Having a quorum reduces the risks of having addresses with a very small amount of the total supply taking decisions on behalf of all the other veANGLE holders. Right now, its not possible to update automatically the quorum based on dynamic values on Snapshot. A quorum on Angle Snapshot space is a way to ensure that proposals taken by the Angle protocol are considered by a significant portion of the DAO participants. The main risk with a quorum that is too high is that it may paralyze the state of the protocol."
619,[ARFC] Add MKR to Ethereum v3,"--- Title: [ARFC] Add MKR to Ethereum v3. Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting ACI and 3SE. Dated: 2023-02-18. --- Summary. This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard MKR to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. MKR is the governance token of the Maker DAO ecosystem. MKR token holders govern the Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power DAI. There is currently $12.71m of MKR deposited into Aave v2 on Ethereum. This proposal grants Aave the opportunity to list the governance token of the community supporting DAI which contributes $167m of TVL on the Ethereum v2 deployment. This ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting. Motivation. Maker DAO has over $7.45B in TVL and is ranked second on Defi Llama TVL rankings. The Maker Protocol is only deployed on the Ethereum network. The stable coin DAI, provides $167m of deposits into Aave v2 on Ethereum, with over $103m of this supply being borrowed by users.

639,[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 onto Kava EVM Network,"FranklinDAO Governance (previously PennBlockchain) and Kava Labs are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on Kava Network. Kava Labs: @tommykavalabs. Summary. We believe Kavas co-chain architecture will be highly beneficial to the Uniswap ecosystem. Furthermore, Kavas programs and newly implemented multi-chain Ethereum bridge positions the Kava Network for extraordinary growth in the next coming years. Through this deployment, both Uniswap and Kava can mutually benefit from operating within one anothers ecosystems. We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. About Kava. Kava Chain is a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that implements a co-chain infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of both Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cosmos co-chain is highly scalable and allows Kava to connect to the over 35 chains and over $60B within the Cosmos ecosystem through its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It is optimized for Cosmos SDK developers and incorporates Cosmos' security and speed in Kavas infrastructure. The Ethereum co-chain supports EVM smart contract compatibility that enables Kava to execute the majority of current smart contracts. The Kava translator module allows both of these co-chains to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling developers to develop projects in their choice of execution environment. Kava Labs is the developer team responsible for launching and maintaining Kavas native protocols. These protocols are the following: Kava Mint: Kava Mint is a CDP protocol that allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and receive the Kava native stablecoin USDX. This loan usually has interest rates hovering between 0-5% USDX can be used in the Kava DeFi ecosystem to earn rewards. Kava Lend: Kava Lend is the borrowing and lending platform on Kava where users can supply or borrow tokens accepted by the network. Supply or borrowing tokens gives users the opportunity to earn APY. Kava Swap: Kava Swap is a DEX protocol that allows users to swap tokens accepted by the network. Providing liquidity in these pools gives users the chance to earn extra APY. Kava Earn: Kava Earn is a protocol that allows users to invest in complex DeFi strategies with a simplified supply/withdrawal system. Kavas latest updates are Kava 11 and Kava 12, which both add additional improvements to growth incentives and network security. In terms of growth, Kava is launching Kava Liquid, which will be its first fully convertible staking protocol. Kava Liquid will unlock all staked bKAVA for use in DeFi protocols that operate on the Kava Network. This will be further supported by new protocol Kava Boost which will let users ""supercharge their Kava rewards with bKAVA. In terms of security, the Kava Network is forming the Kava Foundation to enhance network security and aid in critical infrastructure development. The Kava Foundation will determine how to use the Kava community pool to improve critical infrastructure on the network. Proposal. Uniswaps deployment on Kava would be immensely beneficial to the Uniswap Foundation, becoming an early pillar in the core infrastructure of a rapidly growing network. As a proven L1 network with a highly active user-base, the Kava network provides many benefits currently unrealized to the Uniswap network. Below are some critical improvements that Uniswap deployment on Kava would bring: Developer Incentive Programs: In early 2022, Kava launched its Kava Rise program, a $750M on-chain developer incentive program. The program funding model distributes rewards to developers building on Kavas Ethereum co-chain and Cosmos co-chain. The top 100 DeFi protocols on Kava receive pro-rata rewards distributions every month based on user activity on that protocol. Uniswaps deployment on Kava would allow Uniswap projects to acquire a significant amount of this $750M allocation. Becoming active on the Kava Network early in this programs lifespan would enable Uniswap based projects to thrive on this rapidly growing network. Entry into Cosmos Ecosystem: Uniswaps deployment on Kava would also enable access to the Cosmos project ecosystem. Cosmos is one of the most widely utilized execution environments, with Kavas use of its IBC protocol allowing access to the 35+ chains and $60B on the Cosmos ecosystem. Uniswap would gain access to this wide range of users and projects to improve its own ecosystem. Unlocking Liquidity: The recent Kava 11 update launched Kava Liquid, which establishes a foundation for unlocking all staked bKAVA on the network for use in protocols. Converting staked KAVA to bKAVA and supplying bKAVA to new protocols to boost APY improves the performance of all protocols on the Kava network. By deploying Uniswap on Kava, Uniswap protocols can take advantage of these new features to boost their own returns and increase their user activity. Reinforces Ethos: Kava 11 and 12 recently launched new initiatives that encourage Uniswaps ethos of decentralization and security. Kava Liquid allows users to select validators and retain voting power even while staking. This ensures that users are still decentralized and possess their own voting rights. Kava 12 also announced its implementation of Cosmos DAO technology to assist in emission control for the Kava Community Pool. The community pool will be utilized to address critical infrastructure needs as the network continues to scale. Both of these elements support key characteristics of Uniswaps DAO ethos. Security. Given all the discussion and somewhat ambiguity around the bridging solution, we would like to proceed with first a snapshot check on the deployment onto Kava Chain itself, followed by that respective on-chain vote. Then, if this passes, we will have a snapshot vote to finalize what bridging solution will be used. Below, we highlight Axelar bridge, a solution proposed and recommended by the team. However, to be clear, this bridge will be voted on after (if) the deployment vote itself passes and then, incorporating community feedback, a snapshot vote will happen to finalize this. Axelar: Axelar is a decentralized interchain protocol implemented in Byzantine systems like that used in Kava. It contains a dynamic validator set that connects across a diverse set of consensus mechanisms with arbitrary payloads. Some of the core features of Axelar include: A permissionless set of 60 validators based on delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the Cosmos SDK. Security policies for validators like mandatory key rotations and network suspension function in the case of malicious activity. Completion of over 20 audits and bug bounties to ensure the network is at its most secure. Axelar also provides a wide variety of other functions that serve interoperability needs. These include token transfers that allow the sending and retrieving of tokens across chains. It additionally includes general messaging passing that enables any function to be called on EVM chains from within dApps. Axelar also supports gas services that assist in prepaying the estimated cost for any generally messaging passing action. Details for Incentivized Adoption. Upon deployment, Uniswap would be enrolled into the $750M Kava Rise incentive program. This is a TVL based liquidity mining program, where each protocol on the Kava chain receives incentives in proportion to the amount of TVL on the chain. Current reward distribution is 1M Kava/month. The reward distribution amount will also increase as the ecosystem grows, based on governance vote. Rewards are distributed monthly, usually by the second half of the following month. Because of this important deployment, the team is allocating at least $3M over the next 3 years to these Uniswap pools, from the Kava Rise incentive program. We expect the real allocation to be much higher over the year, depending on how much market share Uniswap attracts. As an example, DefiLlama currently reports Uniswap v3 to have $66.94M TVL on Optimism. If Uniswap had the same amount of TVL on Kava, we can do the math: ($66.94M/$305.39M - total Kava TVL) =21.91% of total TVL on Kava. Uniswap would essentially be getting 21.91% of monthly rewards for that month, which is 1M Kava 21.91% = 219,100 Kava that month. These rewards are paid out every single month, and the Kava Rise program is planned to run for several years. A weighted average of TVL reported by DefiLlama is used for calculation of rewards. There are no lock ups for the rewards. Rewards will be administered by the Kava Labs team. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Kava Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Kava provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Kava by Kava Labs]through the ""Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 21 albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team. Timeline. After passing the initial Snapshot Check to deploy to Kava EVM, we are looking forward to an on-chain vote, and granted that is passed, we will then have a snapshot vote to determine and finalize what bridging solution we will be using. Then we will be ready to deploy Uniswap v3 onto the Kava EVM network.","This proposal is about deploying Uniswap v3 onto the Kava Network, a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK which has Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and supports EVM smart contracts.

641,OIP-132: wstETH/OHM Boosted Liquidity Engine,"Summary. Launch a Boosted Liquidity Engine for the wstETH/OHM pool on Balancer with a maximum vault capacity of $5m in wstETH. To match this, approve the minting of up to $5m in OHM for this vault in order for both assets to be deployed in a 50/50 liquidity pool. Background. The Boosted Liquidity Engine (BLE) leverages Olympus' competitive advantages (monetary policy flexibility and treasury strength) to mint OHM into liquidity pools with select high quality assets. LPs bring an asset (e.g., stablecoin, LSD) into newly developed vaults and the Olympus treasury mints OHM in equal value (for 50/50 pools) to match and create a complete LP position. LPs benefit from boosted liquidity mining opportunities and partner protocols are able to more efficiently drive liquidity mining programs and deepen supplemental liquidity for their tokens. Olympus benefits from LPs providing counter asset liquidity, enhancing OHMs liquidity depth, which enables greater utility and stability. Furthermore, the BLE can be a powerful tool for partnerships. BLE is not intended to be utilized for any and all assets but rather select high-quality assets with which an OHM pairing would be beneficial. For more information on the Boosted Liquidity Engine please refer to OIP-131. Vault Details. The wstETH/OHM vault will be the first deployment of a BLE. As third parties add wstETH into the vault, the protocol will mint OHM to match this and deploy it into the liquidity pool and stake it to receive incentives. All the reward tokens earned through this vault will be directed to wstETH depositors. The protocol itself will not receive these tokens, with the exception of trading fees which are accrued inside the LP token itself. The proposed vault will launch with the following parameters: - Maximum capacity: $5m in wstETH provided by third parties & $5m in OHM minted by the protocol. - Pool: 50/50 wstETH/OHM on Balancer. - Incentivization strategy: Aura staking & LDO rewards. - Oracle: Chainlink. - Fee: 0% Note that the maximum mint capacity is perpetual and can be utilized by the contracts until the vault closes and/or a governance vote changes these parameters.","This proposal is about launching a Boosted Liquidity Engine for the wstETH/OHM pool on Balancer.

642,OIP-133: Staking Rate Strategy,"Motivation - ""how do we make 80% of OHM productive? The objective of this initiative is to formalize a strategy of turning the currently unproductive staked OHM and encouraging more productive behavior in the ecosystem. The projects outlined in Olympus DAOs 2023 product delivery lineup are all huge steps forward in building out the OHM ecosystem, but the current staking model is not really compatible with them. Specifically, staking acts as an unnecessary hurdle for these projects to clear. We should have a plan in place to encourage transitioning from staking to these new products as they go live. There are three Options below, which range from gentle to aggressive in terms of transition speed. Option 1: One-time OHM bond as a temporary replacement. Steps taken: - Wait until lending AMO test is concluded, and for Flex Loan and alOHM have decent alternatives. - Issue a single bond market at fixed 7.33% to mature in 6 months. - After bond market closes, begin turning staking to 0 (cliff or slower decline tbd) The problem solved: Several projects are more complicated to complete due to staking existing and the gOHM tokens ubiquity: OHM bonds, on chain gov, LP farming, and lending OHM for example. However, moving staking to zero now without an acceptable replacement risks a very poor user experience with no solid timeframe for improvement. The compromise is to use an OHM bond to fill the gap while these projects are being worked on. Users who want ""simple yield can get into the bond. Meanwhile the ""use case projects are easier to complete since they don't have to compete with gOHM anymore. Option 1 Pros: - Projects have better chance of success and are simpler to execute. - Lowers emissions now; saves potentially $millions in OHM emissions. - Maintains a base use case for users; ""softens the blow. - ""Forces users to search out better yield opportunities and use their OHM. Option 1 Cons: - More complicated to manage vs keeping staking around. - Requires partnership buy-in (flex loans, alOHM, Euler/Silo) - Potentially high dev effort to make fixed rate OHM bond at scale. - High user effort; must unstake and move to OHM bond to maintain yield. - Potential for above average sell off on maturity. - Short term solution that will need addressing in a fixed time frame. Option 2: Wait to touch staking until suitable alternative projects are completed. Steps taken: - Wait until the following projects are implemented and successful: Lending. Leverage. LP farming. OHM bond vaults. Once the above list is satisfied, reduce staking to 0% The problem solved: Staking is the core of the protocol currently, and gOHM is everywhere. Killing gOHMs ""simple yield option before alternatives arise is a surefire way to put the protocol in a bad position. We need to give the market time to find other solutions organically.

Option 2 Pros: - Simple, ""wait and see approach. - Low risk of community disillusion with yet another change, Gives community plenty of time to warm up and embrace the idea. - Gives partners plenty of time to find alternative yield paths. Option 2 Cons: - High cost in emissions vs ending staking sooner, potentially in the $millions. - Does not solve the issue of staking cannibalizing on the success of other alternative projects (OHM bonds for example) - Impacts the likelihood of users seeking out of alternative yield sources while they are being rolled out (think: lending, LPing, or things under discussion like a passive OHM pool for Gearbox) - Potentially negative feedback loop of ""wait and see, but the problem could be staking so we never get to see. Option 3: Stepwise staking reduction.

Its less risky than Option 1 while still reducing the long term protocol cost. Its ""smarter than Option 2 while still avoiding complexity. Option 3 Pros: - Relatively simple. - Lowers cost to the protocol. - Allows other projects to somewhat breathe and buys them time to be successful before fully killing staking.

The three Options outlined are ways of transitioning away from staking while minimizing the risks associated with doing so. Option 1 suggests creating a one-time bond market at 7.33% interest rate for 6 months, as a temporary replacement until new projects like lending AMO and Flex Loan are complete. Option 2 suggests waiting until these projects are complete before reducing staking rates, while Option 3 proposes gradually reducing staking rates over time until they reach 0%.

661, [BIP-212] Deploy Balancer to zkSync,"Motivation. The rise of zkEVMs is likely to be a major theme as head into the second half of 2023 and beyond. One of the most promising of these is [zkSync]([link]) which has been under development for the last 4 years by Matter Labs. Many Balancer contributors have a keen interest in being early movers to the zkRollup/zkEVM narrative and have been closely following the progress of zkSync. As we approach the launch of the public network its time for the community to assess if proceeding with a Balancer deployment makes sense. You can go down the [list of projects]([link]) expected to be in the zkSync ecosystem and theres many well known names. If this proposal passes our goal will be to arrive as early as possible, likely with only basic weighted & stable pools on launch day and no BAL emissions. We'd then assess the landscape for potential boosted pools as we get the veBAL integration online to enable emissions to begin. Notable Layer Zero is expected to support zkSync so we can expect cross chain gauge boosts to be available, thus allowing Aura to join us :slight_smile: Obviously we're early to zkEVMss so its hard to say who the winners will be and if zkSync will be among them. Ultimately it does not take much effort from us to do this deployment so in my mind its prudent to be early and wrong versus risk being left behind as a latecomer. I want Balancer to be seen as an industry leader in embracing new technology and I think deploying to zkSync fits perfectly into that narrative. Specification. No particular on-chain action will be executed with this proposal. If approved, various Balancer contributors will work towards deploying to zkSync and being one of the very first apps available after the public launch.

If the community agrees, Balancer will try to join as early as possible, although at first, it would just create simple pools and wouldn't generate any BAL tokens. Over time, they'd look at potentially expanding. The aim is to position Balancer as a leading innovator in the field, with the risk being that it's still unclear how big or successful zkSync will be. Overall, though, it's not a huge effort on Balancer's part to give this a go. If the community doesn't agree, they won't move forward with this and will discuss other options.

666,Deploy Aave V3 to Metis Andromeda Mainnet,"Summary. Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet. Proposal: About Metis. Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum. Andromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereums underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitaliks proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollups security with plasmas scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals. Our second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren't previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change. Third, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference. When combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris' operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder. MetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy. Committed to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways: Builder Mining Rewards. Ecosystem Grants. Genesi DAC Investments The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices) As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aaves multichain expansion. Technical Evaluation by BGD. In the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows: Oracle Infrastructure: Optimal. Blockchain Explorer: Good. Compatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal. Compatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal. RPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable. Custom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal. Support of wallet providers: Good. On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good. Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good. Chain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable. Bridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal. Commitment in security-incidents: Optimal. Network security/technical model: Good RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards. Chain data/indexing solutions: We're currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem. [link] Risk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet. Gauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. [link] Incentivized Adoption. We are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time. Next Steps. Assuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.","This proposal is about Metis Andromeda, an Ethereum Layer 2 that provides scalability and decentralized functionalities.

684,[FIP - 199] REVISED: Metronome <> Frax: Partnership and Incentives Strategy,"Authors. Zane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Jordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Summary. Deploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team. Match CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools. Metronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite. Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS. Revisions. This proposal is a revision of a previous proposal. The following changes were made: CVX match reduced to 110,000 and broken down between msUSD-fraxBP and msETH-frxETH. sfrxETH collateral has already been deployed to Metronome. Background and Motivation. Metronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project Vesper - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle) Metronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on. Specifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a ""yield-plus experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY) Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an ""msETH synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today. This mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome) In return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities. Section 0: Pool Deployment. Frax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight. Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget. Frax team will match 110,000 CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months) Metronome treasury currently holds [roughly 165,000 CVX]([link]) We intend to split the composite 220,000 CVX (110,000 matched 1:1) as follows: msUSD-FraxBP: 150,000 CVX msETH-frxETH: 70,000 CVX. This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges. Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper. Currently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome. As of recently, sfrxETH is also integrated as collateral onto Metronome. Vesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include: Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX Aave v3 sfrxETH-borrow-Stablecoins Future strategies as they become available. The Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral. Section 3: Program Extension. The above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS. In particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY. Should there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program. In addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome. In the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains. Lastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO. Summary. Prioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome.

691, [BIP-216] Add permissions for Batch Relayer V5 (second attempt),"[Payload PR - BIP-216]([link]) Background on repeat governance. [BIP-214]([link]) was approved by governance, but upon review, which occurred after the snapshot, was found to specify the old V4 version of the relayer in both the BIP text and the payloads. The problem resulted the fact that there are many batch relayers with the same contract name. The script used found the most recent address of a given contract by looking through a reverse lookup table in the monorepo that was not up-to-date. The BIP-214 text specified the BalancerRelayer as the target to receive permissions, but did not include details about which deployment was listed. The script that generates these BIPs [has been updated]([link]) to allow for targets to be specified as task/deployment (specified a specific version) and to print that information back out in the tables. The revised script was used to regenerate the BIP output and payloads defined below. Background on the change.

706,[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Gnosis Chain,"in conjunction with the Gnosis Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. Overview of Gnosis Chain. Formerly known as the xDai Chain, Gnosis has been in development since 2018 and has continued to build and grow throughout the years. Gnosis includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other features that enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost transactions, and the ability to construct trustless bridges. The Gnosis Chain team has demonstrated their dedication towards the growth and adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. Gnosis Chains objective is to expedite the advancement of Ethereum and expand its reach. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain will offer various advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. With Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at [link] Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC. Gnosis Chains ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees  an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platforms capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at [link] Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a trustless bridge architecture that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment. The Gnosis Chains unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform. Proposal. This proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that its fair for their work to come into fruition after a year. This proposal comes at a crucial time as Uniswaps V3 license is expiring soon. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise. Echoing the post made by the Gnosis team, supports Uniswap deployment on Gnosis with Wormhole as the bridge provider for a number of reasons. Wormhole was recently voted-in as the bridge provider for Uniswap deployment on BSC. With this in mind, Wormhole has the necessary tools to facilitate deployment on Gnosis Chain due to the already developed mechanisms needed for BSC deployment. While we understand that security is a concern, the extent of Uniswap design that Wormhole will be responsible for are protocol parameters such as fees. We are aware that there is an on-going discussion on using a multi-bridge design; however, it is expected to take months with a high likelihood of delays. On the other hand, deployment on GC is expected to be ready within a week or two after governance approval. Note that we are not against changing this design through governance later on should a more secure and efficient method arise. Final Thoughts. As we stated in our post previously, there is a tradeoff between choosing the most efficient bridge provider and the urgency of deployment. With the bridge assessment committees findings expected to be released far later than the license expiry, its more pressing to cement Uniswaps presence on these chains. Emphasis should be placed on the primary purpose to execute proposals governing this deployment. This ensures that Uniswaps decentralized governance model stays robust and responsive to the evolving needs of the ecosystem, regardless of the underlying chain. We believe that when a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution.","In this passage, Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis Team are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Gnosis Chain.

This could notably benefit Perpetual Protocol, a trading platform already on Gnosis Chain. Users of Uniswap can benefit from the platform's low fees and faster transactions. The Gnosis Chain's interoperability with Ethereum, the capacity to support various blockchain features and schemes already supported by Ethereum, and current low operational costs make it a desirable choice for such development. Finally, an ecosystem fund from the GnosisDAO treasury would help drive Uniswap v3 adoption on the chain, promoting overall activity and growth.","The proposal suggests deploying Uniswap V3 on Gnosis Chain, a blockchain platform that offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. This deployment will benefit both Uniswap Labs and its users by increasing liquidity and activity on the platform. Gnosis Chain already supports other popular DeFi protocols and offers seamless compatibility with Ethereum. It also has a diverse and decentralized validator set and is working on a trustless bridge architecture to connect with Ethereum. By deploying on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap can optimize trades, maximize returns, and enhance the user experience. The proposal also suggests using funds from Gnosis Chain's ecosystem fund to promote Uniswap adoption and attract more users. This proposal has been in discussion for some time and now is a crucial time to capture the opportunity before Uniswap's V3 license expires. Wormhole is suggested as the bridge provider for the deployment, and while there are discussions on a multi-bridge design, it may take longer to implement. Overall, the proposal aims to ensure Uniswap's presence on various chains, strengthen its decentralized governance, and adapt to the evolving needs of the ecosystem.","This text is about a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Gnosis Chain. This would provide various advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users, such as low gas costs and faster blocks for more efficient transactions. It would also support compatibility with Ethereum and offer user incentives to promote adoption of the platform. The Gnosis team is pushing for this proposal to come into fruition after a year of discussion, in order to capture the value that could be extracted from Uniswpas expiring V3 license before other forks arise. The proposal suggests using Wormhole as the bridge provider because they have already developed mechanisms used for BSC deployments. When a more efficient design is found, multi-chain deployment should be altered accordingly.","Gnosis has been in development since 2018 and has continued to build and grow throughout the years. Gnosis includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other features that enable faster blocks and epochs. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases. Uniswap is being deployed on the Gnosis Chain. The Gnosis team is also working on a trustless bridge architecture that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability. The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment. GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. We suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. Wormhole was recently voted-in as the bridge provider for Uniswap deployment on BSC. Wormhole has the necessary tools to facilitate deployment on Gnosis Chain. There is a tradeoff between choosing the most efficient bridge provider and the urgency of deployment. With the bridge assessment committees findings expected to be released far later than the license expiry, its more pressing to cement Uniswaps presence on these chains. We believe that when a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution"
709,[ARFC] Add LDO to Ethereum Aave v3,"shortDescription: Add LDO to Ethereum Aave v3 deployment as collateral, with borrowing enabled. author: [Token Logic]([link]) via [Llama]([link]) dated: 2023-03-26. Summary. This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add LDO to the Ethereum V3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. LDO would be the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol governance token to be listed on Aave. Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDOs price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai. The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers. Motivation. Lido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs. The Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract]([link]) Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools. LDO Token Ethereum Address: '[hexadecimals]' LDO is a Top 50 token by market cap, currently ranked [36th]([link]) by Coingecko. Lido Protocol is the largest minter of liquid staked ETH tokens with [4,917,554 ETH staked]([link]) Making LDO available on Aave v3 would make Aave V3 the first major lending market to do so and would benefit from the first mover advantage. Currently, stETH is listed on Aave v2 and wstETH is listed on the Aave v3 Ethereum liquidity pools. wstETH has also been approved by Aave Governance for being listed on the Optimism, Arbitrum and hopefully the Polygon v3 liquidity pools. Lido DAO would like to also propose to include the Lido governance token, LDO. [Add wstETH on v3 Optimism]([link]) [Add wstETH on v3 Arbitrum]([link]) [Add wstETH on v3 Polygon]([link]) Specification. This section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combined recommendation of Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.

714,[TEMP CHECK] - Aave V1 Offboarding Plan,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] - Aave V1 Offboarding Plan. Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative. Date: 2023-03-17. Simple Summary This Temperature Check proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. Background Aave V1 has been frozen since December 2022, and users have been given ample time to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1. Motivation Aave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem. Specification The offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1. New Rate Strategies For each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented: 1. uOptimal: 20% 2. reserveFactor: 99.9% 3. base rate: 3% 4. slope 1: 7% 5. slope 2: 200% These changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms. Next Steps 1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal. 2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal. 3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

The 2023 Gotchi Lodge was a major success, with the Aavegotchi project being one of the best-represented projects at ETH Denver 2023. The Lodge started with six core team members but quickly became the Gotchi Hostel, accommodating seven Gotchigang cavalry members into the mix. These members proved to be critical to the great representation we had across all venues. Key performance metrics proved challenging to quantify, but there was a noticeable increase in Twitter and discord engagement, Bazaar activity, External and internal enthusiasm for Aavegotchi, and BD/partnership leads post-event. While the impact went far, we would like to fairly compensate all attending members at appropriate rates for the work done, and the initial budget set out for the event cannot accommodate that. Below is a complete breakdown of estimated vs actual hours, unforeseen expenses, preparation and long-tail labor (not taken into account), and finally, our request in USD terms. This being our first IRL activation as AavegotchiDAO, we over-delivered and initially underestimated ourselves, and the current budget reflects that. As a team, we are coming away from this event with immense experience in planning future events. Deliverables. The team hit across all metrics in the initial proposal and then some. There was a noticeable increase in internal and external enthusiasm for the Aavegotchi protocol during our presence in Denver. Estimated hours vs actual. The original Estimate for a workday was: 7 hours/day. $15/hr. Ten days in total. Final Production Payout Structure was updated to: 12 hours/day (reflective of actual hours from arriving and leaving main venues) $21/hr. Ten days in total for core event staff. Additional days allocated for long tail labor regarding prep and post-production. Unforeseen Expenses. Calvary team members' support; all who stepped up put in immense work and were critical to our mission. Most of them gave up their booth-browsing time to help us. Sticker production costs were late-stage additions, but immense value adds in promoting Aavegotchi + creating awareness for Fake Gotchis. Crafting supplies for Marijuana mansion, Art Work Prints, and Framing. An extensive amount of driving for the vehicle team. Preparation and long-tail labor. We genuinely undervalued and underestimated the work on the front and back end of EthDenver. Front end. Hefe & Mycaleum: Many hours were spent planning, scheduling, and working with event organizers to secure panel slots. We also put time into budget management and funding necessary travel expenses for team members while waiting for the initial funding proposal to clear. Back end. NoFuturistic continues to work on post-event content editing and distribution. Hefe & Mycaleum: We have been working on the budget with actual expenses as well as the distribution of costs and compensation. We also put lots of time into crafting this budget extension proposal.

738,Uniswap V3 Launch on zkEVM,"Point of Contact: Jack Melnick, TG: jackmelnick, email: . Proposal summary. Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM. Overview of proposal. We propose to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswaps protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as ""zkEVM on behalf of the community. We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons: Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility. An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations. A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values. About Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: - L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2); - Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1); - Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS); - Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more. The Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured. Motivation. Theres significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswaps place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, its only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority. Partner Details. Polygon Labs. This proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks. Partner Legal. The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as ""Polygon Labs. Delegate Sponsor. There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community. Conflict of Interest Declaration. There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswaps legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures. KPI & Success Criteria. Target KPIs. There are generally 2 forms of projects: 1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here. ![[image]]([link]) 2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives) These are more completion based. ![[image]]([link]) What does success look like? Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswaps Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade. What potential risks are there for this projects success? How could they be mitigated? Risk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereums core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. The bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygons zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain. Protocol security. Please address the following questions if you're proposing a cross-chain deployment: Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? There are two ways to use the bridge: - Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that. - Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Here we assume no possibility for fraud. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.","This proposal is about authorizing Uniswap Labs to deploy their protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) on behalf of the community.

Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow UnisWaps Total Addressable Market across TVL. Polygons zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. The deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain. Please address the following questions if you're proposing a cross-chain deployment. There are two ways to use the bridge: - Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. - Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge.

749,agEUR Seniority in the Core Module,"This is a vote to decide on whether agEUR holders should be considered senior over other protocol stakeholders (Standard Liquidity Providers, Hedging Agents) in the Angle Protocol Core module when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the smart contracts and the voted parameters. In the specific case of the Euler hack and the potential losses faced by the protocols Core module, deciding on agEUR seniority would mean that once the protocol reopens its peg should be defended using the collateral leftover in the protocol, potentially at the expense of other protocol stakeholders (Standard Liquidity Providers and Hedging Agents notably) Taking this vote will give the DAO the foundation to move forward with next steps following the Euler situation. Context. On March 13th 2023, Euler Protocol suffered a $197m hack, which led Angle Protocol to lose the 17.6m USDC it had lent on Euler at the time. Prior to the Euler hack, the Angle Core module had a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $36.1m and the protocol had holdings of different assets spread across various chains worth ~$1.0m. 17.3m agEUR had been minted through the Core module. In addition, the protocol had: - ~$11.8m in deposits from its [Standard Liquidity Providers]([link]) - ~$71.0k in deposits from [Hedging Agents]([link]) - a surplus of approximately $6.5m. If the funds from the hack (17,614,940.03 USDC) were to be definitely lost, the value of the DAO holdings would be down to approximately $19.5m. In this case, the amount of reserves in the Core module would become inferior to the value of the claims of agEUR holders, of Standard Liquidity Providers, and of the remaining hedging agents in the protocol, as a whole. Should agEUR be considered senior, as the value of the assets of the protocol remains superior to the value of the agEUR issued by the Core module, the protocol could defend its peg using its collateral reserves. [This page]([link]) has more details on the state of the protocol after the hack. As of the 30th of March 2023, a portion of the funds of the hack has been repaid by the hacker. Yet, it is still uncertain how this will route to Angle DAO and with what timeline. Even if a proportional amount of what has been repaid by the hacker was given back to the protocol through Euler, the protocol would still be in a loss situation. Following the hack, the main features of the protocol were paused by its [emergency multisig]([link]) Due to the hack and to the protocol being paused, agEUR has lost its 1 peg. As it stands, if the contracts were unpaused with the pre-Euler hack parameters, it would lead to a bank run situation as agEUR would be redeemable 1-1 against reserve assets, and sanTokens would be redeemable at 1-1 at first, then with a slippage once the collateral ratio is lower. In the end, the last users would be left with nothing as the smart contracts would likely have nothing left to redeem assets against. Some have suggested that instead of running into this bank run scenario, the remaining assets could remain frozen and be redistributed differently according to what is voted. The key question to decide on, regardless of the outcome of the Euler hack, is to determine the order of ""seniority among the different token holders of the protocol. The DAO needs to decide this question not only for the Euler situation, but for all potential such events in the future where a loss accrues in the protocols Core module and is not automatically taken into account by the smart contracts or the voted parameters. Vote. The uncertainty from the Euler situation (about the distribution of the repayment proceeds by the Euler DAO and subsequent repayments by the hacker) may last for quite some time, so the vote here is to clarify the situation for all Angle Protocol stakeholders. This vote is done here in the context of the Euler hack where the DAO may potentially experience a loss, but the intent of this vote is to be a general resolution about the seniority of holdings in the protocols Core module. While, following the Euler situation, a lot of detailed scenarios have been discussed on [Angle Governance forum]([link]) and [on Discord]([link]), the point of this vote is to decide whether agEUR must be considered senior in the Angle Protocols Core module over other protocol stakeholders (Hedging Agents, Standard Liquidity Providers) when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the smart contracts and the voted parameters. In the context of the Euler hack, seniority for agEUR holders would mean that if and when the protocols Core module reopens, agEUR peg should be maintained using the available collateral reserves in the protocol. Implementation and next steps. This vote should not be followed by any immediate action on the protocol. Because this vote is about principles rather than implementation, any plan to solve the current Euler situation if the loss stays as it is would still need to be discussed by the DAO and abide by the foundation this vote provides regarding seniority. For the specific Euler case and the current potential loss faced by the protocol, conditions under which the protocol should be reopened would need to be discussed and addressed in future proposals and votes. Based on the outcome of this vote, and should the protocol loss remain as it is (with nothing from the hacker redistributed to the protocol), there could be a lot of different scenarios to consider to solve the current situation. In the case where agEUR is voted as senior, there could be discussions on the rest of the waterfall, with for instance ideas on whether some Standard Liquidity Providers should have seniority over others, or whether there should be some form of preference for governance token holders in a subsequent breakdown of funds. If agEUR is not voted as senior, the same considerations could arise around the levels of seniority of SLPs or HAs. For this vote, and for future discussions, there are already some places in the docs that refer to this kind of situation: - [Angle Core Module collateral settlement]([link]) with an example implementation [here]([link]) - [Page about SLPs]([link]) - [Angle Core Module risks and emergency solutions]([link]) In all cases, there would also need to be discussions on how to technically implement the next steps that would have been chosen. Voting Options. 1. For agEUR holders seniority over other protocol stakeholders in the Angle Core module. For establishing agEUR seniority over any other assets of Angle Core Module when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the Core Modules smart contracts and the voted parameters. In particular, this means that the agEUR holders would be senior to other protocol stakeholders (including Hedging Agents and Standard Liquidity Providers) 2. Against agEUR holders seniority over other protocol stakeholders in the Angle Core module. In this case, specific discussions would need to be held to see how to distribute a loss among protocol stakeholders (whether agEUR holders, Hedging Agents or Standard Liquidity Providers) whenever a loss that is not automatically handled by the Core modules smart contracts and the voted parameters accrues.","The proposal is about a vote to decide whether agEUR holders should be considered senior over other protocol stakeholders (Standard Liquidity Providers, Hedging Agents) in the Angle Protocol Core module if there is a loss that cannot be handled automatically by the smart contracts and the voted parameters.

The proposal seeks to decide if agEUR holders should get priority over other protocol stakeholders such as Standard Liquidity Providers and Hedging Agents, when a loss occurs that can't be automatically handled by the smart contracts. The context for this vote comes from a recent hack on Euler Protocol that indirectly affected Angle, causing losses and disrupting the protocol's primary functions. The results from this vote, though inspired by this hack, would serve as a general rule for handling similar situations in the future. Specifically, if agEUR holders are given priority, it would mean in situations of financial losses, the worth of agEUR will be maintained using whatever reserves are available. Depending on the outcome of the vote, future discussions will delve into how losses are distributed if agEUR is not given priority and also how this principle will be technically implemented.","This proposal is about deciding whether agEUR holders should have priority over other stakeholders in the Angle Protocol Core module in case of a loss.

It is important to note that this vote is about principles and does not result in immediate action.","The proposal is about deciding whether holders of a digital asset called agEUR should have higher priority over other stakeholders (such as Standard Liquidity Providers and Hedging Agents) in the Angle Protocol Core module when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the smart contracts and voted parameters.

With the end of the curve, a substantial amount of funds has been given to the DAO. The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe its crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO. DAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. Thats why I am running for the position of treasurer. The purpose of the treasurer role would be to: - Ensure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without missinterprertation possible. - Ensure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc. - Prepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all. - Stay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury. Additionally, the role would also serve as an ""expert"" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO. As a current director, I receive a payment of 2,000 GHST every three months. Given the active nature of the treasurer role, I plan to dedicate two hours per day to this role and will be requesting an increase in compensation to 5,000 GHST per three months. Why choose me? I possess in-depth knowledge of DeFi and market making, enabling me to provide valuable advice on all financial decisions related to the DAO. I am well-versed in the DAOs structure and DAO fund locations. I think having a go-to person for all treasury matters can be helpful for the DAO. My participation in the Curve transition team and in directors group allow me to be aware and understand every fund move.

I will also be writing a similar proposal in Anata DAO to provide Anata holders with Aavegotchis. The Anata team would TWAP buy GHST and purchase Aavegotchis / Portals on the marketplace for our holders to participate in the Gotchiverse. ABOUT Anata is a collection of 2,000 Anime Themed VTube rigged avatars. It is the NFT you use on calls, streams, meetings, etc. Each anata counts as one vote in Anata DAO. Anata is an art project heavily catered towards content creators. So far, the DAO has voted to provide every Anata NFT holder a 3D VRM, 1/1 PFP, Chibi, Upgraded 2D Vtuber Files, Gaming & Metaverse world integrations. Holders - 950. Active Members - 100 (ish) Treasury - $4m+ Team - BigDSenpai, Grug, DCF God, Herro WHY I am a big believer in Aavegotchi. Some of you may remember I used to stream opening H1-H2 portals and giving away gotchis at random to the community. I didn't have a Face Cam though - an Anata VTUBE avatar would have been perfect while playing - which makes chat and video way more interactive. Anata has a very large gaming sector, with gaming events & nights firing off 4-5 times per week. It would be great to intertwine what we are doing with Pudgy Penguins, Cozy Penguins and other communities with Aavegotchi games. TLDR; more exposure into the gotchiverse by helping eachother get community members involved in both projects. COST A) $10,000 DAI (4-5 Anata) B) $20,000 DAI (9-11 Anata) C) Do Nothing. Average Anata price is .69-1ETH, the ""cost"" really depends on how much the DAO would want to give out to the community. I am all in favor of starting small if everyone else is. The proposal would only be executed assuming the Anata DAO proposal with equal value passes. This is probably the best way to learn about Anata in under 2.5 minutes: [link] VOD of Moon playing Gotchi Miners: [link] ![Screenshot]([link]])","This proposal is about providing the Aavegotchi community with Anata NFTs. The proposal will also be discussed in the Anata DAO, which is a collection of 2,000 Anime-themed Vtube avatars. It would involve TWAP buying GHST and purchasing Aavegotchi's/Portals from the Marketplace for holders to take part in the Gotchiverse. This way, people can participate more interactively with chat and video using an Anata VTUBE avatar while playing.

763,[FIP - 205] Enabling Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC Gauge on Frax Finance Staking,"Introduction. Timeless Finances protocol,[bunni.pro]([link]), is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC gauge in order to receive FXS rewards. Background. Bunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months. Proposal. We propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC 010 [link] Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders. Evaluation of Success. We will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauges by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of the FRAX/USDC liquidity pools along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pools receive. Conclusion. Bunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs. Our liquidity optimization services and incentives will encourage LPs to use our platform and deepen liquidity. We look forward to partnering with Frax Finance and contributing to a better trading experience for everyone involved. References/Useful links.

Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote Duration: 7 days. Discourse thread: [link] Introduction: The Strategotchi team are seeking a grant to complete the design and development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version. The team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability. Introductory post + litepaper: [link] Longterm Value: Additionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption. A Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game. Our game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore. It features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference. Guild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution: [link] Token Sinks: The game will provide a sink for native tokens through ""Ranked Mode buy-ins in GHST and/or alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables. Guild vs Guild: Along with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies. Gotchichain: With the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience. This is why PC sees the potential for Strategotchi to launch with heavy support in Gotchichains launch window. Budget: We are seeking 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) paid in 2 installments.

It also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition.

801,[SCP-133] Addendum to SCP 119,"PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION. This proposal is an Addendum to [SCP-119] and is in response to the announcement of @Diggy stepping down from the role of Product Workstream Leader and moving on from the DAO. The goal of this addendum is to maintain stability, velocity and success in the Product Workstream through the currently approved timeline and provide support, structure and accountability until a full-time Product Leader can be identified, proposed, and voted in. Summary: In accordance with SCP-119, the Product Workstream has had their budget approved through June 15th. With @Diggy stepping down before the end of that timeline, this proposal nominates @Tyler | ShapeShift to become the interim workstream leader of the Product Workstream until a new leader is found as well as promotes @PTT from his roles in both Operations and Product to the new full time role in the Product Workstream under the new title Project Manager & Product Analyst' Motivation: With @Diggy moving on before the end of the current Product Workstream Proposal, there are areas of responsibility that will be left open to fill in: admin, meeting leading and organization, task management, KPI and project tracking/reporting, among other countless Workstream Leader responsibilities. Tyler has proven capable of supporting workstreams outside of Operations in [SCP-99] in stepping into an Interim Workstream Leader role with the Marketing Workstream until another Workstream leader was identified and proposed. This proposal provides temporary assurance of stability and continued success in the goals outlined through the length of [SCP-119] and maintains the structure of the Workstream for the remaining contributors and greater DAO until a proper future Workstream Leader is established. Finding a replacement for the interim leader will be a top priority, and a committee or group of advisors can be formed to help field candidates, hold interviews, and find a new full-time Workstream Leader. Having til June 15 to find the right future workstream leader can provide more assurances to the DAO that we have adequate time to find the perfect fit. If a new Workstream Leader is not selected by the end of the new proposed term limit, a new proposal will be required for renewal of the stream and Interim Workstream Leader. Specification. This proposal addendum identifies Tyler | ShapeShift as the new Interim Product Workstream Leader. Tyler will assume all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Product Workstream while continuing his obligations as the Operations Workstream leader, splitting focus and time. No additional compensation is requested. Under this proposal, Tyler will communicate and advise actively with the current Product Workstream Contributors and provide support and guidance in: Arranging phase 2 strategy talks, and getting the Phase 2 roadmap proposal posted to the forum and moved through governance. Workstream contributor payments made through Colony. Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week. Product/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint. Draft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, and continuing the iterative process to prepare a feature for development. Hosting and Leading Spec breakdowns between Product and Engineering. Scheduling the Osmosis retro and when to prioritize the next phase. Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s. Hoff, whos currently on retainer to make updates to shapeshift.com on an as needed basis will temporarily report in to Beard on a weekly basis to review needs, design work, etc. Additionally under this proposal, @PTT will be moving his focuses and DAO responsibilities to be more aligned with a promotion and title change to a full time Product Workstream contributor with the new title, Project Manager & Product Analyst. Under his new title and role, @PTT will find new and more detailed responsibilities in: Continuing to track results from Phase 1 strategy data and build forecasts based on specific ShapeShift user data to inform future features and integrations. Tracking and reporting on Workstream goals and KPIs. Collaborating with Beard on getting data from Mix Panel and helping present during Product Office Hours and AllFox meetings. Assist with the creation and completion of Product specs. Maintain the Partnership flow and assist with the ShapeShift DAO Grant Committee. Adhoc Product related requests from other DAO Workstreams. Operations lost an additional member of the current Operations Workstream at the end of March with @WesleyGraves leaving his contributor role. There is a strong acknowledgement that Tylers interim position and @PTTs new full time role are only made possible by the remaining Operations Workstream contributors, @Tshifty and @MBMaria stepping up to take on new delegated tasks and responsibilities. As there are 2 Operations Assistant roles being absorbed in the remaining Operations Workstream, @Tshifty and @MBMaria will both be receiving a promotion from Operations Assistant to Operations Coordinator. This proposal expedites a search for a new Product Workstream leader to be identified and integrated, and upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream. Budget. Both the Product and Operations Workstreams will see decreases in their monthly spend if this proposal passes. The currently passed Product Budget has a monthly spend of: $28,245 in USDC. $8,587 in FOX. $36,832 Total. The new Product Budget would be: $22,081.92 in USDC. $5,500 in FOX. $27,581.92 Total. This is a decrease in Monthly Product USDC spend by $5,413.08, and a decrease in total Monthly Product spend by $9,250.08. The currently passed Operations Budget has a monthly spend of: $32,425.00 in USDC. $11,325.00 in FOX. $43,750.00 Total. The new Operations Budget would be: $26,500.00 in USDC. $8,000.00 in FOX. $34,500.00 Total. This is a decrease in Monthly Operations USDC spend by $5,925, and a decrease in total Monthly Operations spend by $9,250. The total decrease in monthly USDC spend for this proposal would be $11,338.08, and the decrease in total monthly spend between the two workstreams would be: $18,500.08. Benefits: This proposal keeps an interim leader at the helm of the Product Workstream that has the full backing and support from this workstream with a proven track record for management and overseeing complicated and complex processes. This also provides support and provides additional time to find the right Product person to fulfill the role. Drawbacks. Tyler | ShapeShift will be operating as a Workstream Leader for two workstreams for a limited amount of time","This proposal is to help support the Product Workstream of the DAO while they search for a new, permanent leader. It proposes Tyler | ShapeShift as an interim leader who will take on all responsibilities outlined in SCP-92 until a new full time leader can be identified, proposed and voted in before June 15th. It also nominates PTT to move his focus over to Product and become their full time Project Manager & Product Analyst with specific tasks delegated for him to fulfill. In order for this proposal to happen, both the Operation and Product Workstreams will have their monthly budget decreased from what was previously approved in SCP-119. The benefits of this proposal are that it provides stability within the workstream, leadership support and additional time needed to find a suitable replacement product leadar. The only downside is that Tyler | ShapeShift will need ot manage two worksteam roles simultaneously for some period of time.","This proposal is to help support the Product Workstream of the DAO while they search for a new, permanent leader.

It suggests that @Tyler | ShapeShift should temporarily lead the Product Workstream until a long-term leader is found. Additionally, @PTT is suggested to switch from Operations and Product roles to solely focus on the Product Workstream as Project Manager & Product Analyst. The Operations Workstream will be carried on by @Tshifty and @MBMaria as Operations Coordinators. Budget adjustments will be performed decreasing the overall monthly spend. The proposal foresees benefits in maintaining consistent leadership and extending the time to find the right leader while pointing out the drawback of @Tyler | ShapeShift being stretched across two major roles for a while.","This proposal aims to maintain stability and success in the Product Workstream after the departure of the current leader. It suggests appointing Tyler | ShapeShift as the interim leader until a permanent replacement is found. Additionally, PTT would be promoted to a full-time role in the Product Workstream. The proposal outlines their responsibilities and tasks, including coordinating meetings, tracking progress, and assisting with product development. The budget for both the Product and Operations Workstreams will decrease if the proposal is approved. While there might be challenges with Tyler handling two workstreams temporarily, having an interim leader ensures continuity and allows time to find the right replacement.","This proposal is for an Addendum to [SCP-119] and is in response to the announcement of @Diggy stepping down from the role of Product Workstream Leader and moving on from the DAO. The goal of this addendum is to maintain stability, velocity and success in the Product Workstream through the currently approved timeline and provide support, structure and accountability until a full-time Product Leader can be identified, proposed, and voted in. Tyler | ShapeShift has been nominated as the interim leader for the Product Workstream, while @PTT will take on a new position as Project Manager & Product Analyst' These positions will help ensure that all responsibilities are covered until a new leader can be found.","Proposal is in response to the announcement of @Diggy stepping down from the role of Product Workstream Leader and moving on from the DAO. The goal of this addendum is to maintain stability, velocity and success in the Product Work stream. @Diggy moving on before the end of the current Product Workstream Proposal, there are areas of responsibility that will be left open to fill in. @PTT will be promoted from his roles in both Operations and Product to the new full time role of Project Manager & Product Analyst. This proposal provides temporary assurance of stability and continued success in the goals outlined through the length of [SCP-119] and maintains the structure of the Workstream for the remaining contributors and greater DAO. Finding a replacement for the interim leader will be a top priority. A committee or group of advisors can be formed to help field candidates, hold interviews, and find a new full-time Workstream Leader. Tyler will assume all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Product Workstream. He will continue his obligations as the Operations Workstream leader, splitting focus and time. No additional compensation is requested.  @PTT will be moving his focuses and DAO responsibilities to be more aligned with a promotion and title change to a full time Product Workstream contributor with the new title, Project Manager & Product Analyst. Under his new title and role, @ PTT will find new and more detailed responsibilities in: Continuing to track results from Phase 1 strategy data and build forecasts based on specific ShapeShift user data.  Operations lost an additional member of the current Operations Workstream at the end of March with @WesleyGraves leaving his contributor role. There is a strong acknowledgement that Tylers interim position and @PTTs new full time role are only made possible by the remaining Operations Work stream contributors. @Tshifty and @MBMaria will both be receiving a promotion from Operations Assistant to Operations Coordinator. Both the Product and Operations Workstreams will see decreases in their monthly spend if this proposal passes. This proposal expedites a search for a new Product Workstream leader to be identified and integrated. Upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Work stream. This proposal keeps an interim leader at the helm of the Product Workstream that has the full backing and support from this workstream. This also provides support and provides additional time to find the right Product person."
808,[BIP-241] Aave v3 Migration,"[link] Motivation. > With the Aave v3 linear pool wrappers ready for deployment in the ecosystem various Boosted Aave v3 pools and pairings have started to crop up in the governance forum. In order to streamline the process of transitioning from the old Aave v2 pool and pairings I on behalf of the Maxis am proposing we close the loop by voting to kill the relevant gauges this week thereby permitting 3 more weeks of emissions on the pool gauges listed below. This will give LPs enough time to migrate their positions and new pools to bootstrap themselves in the BIP-19 cycles. As an adder, a new STG/bb-a-USD gauge will be activated with the execution of this proposal, along with the old one added to the kill list. The STG/bb-a-USD pool will be killed but the same information applies as in [BIP-105.]([link]) We will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges. The old pools listed below will no longer have core pool status. All of the migrated pools will be restored as ""core pools under BIP-19. Pools being migrated: Original deployment -> New pool address. [bb-a-USD]([link]) -> [bb-a-USD]([link]) (Ethereum) [STG / bb-a-USD]([link]) -> [STG/bb-a-USD]([link]) (Ethereum) [staBAL3]([link]) -> [3pool]([link]) (Ethereum) [MaticX / WMATIC]([link]) -> [MaticX / bb-a-WMATIC]([link]) (Polygon) [stMATIC / WMATIC]([link]) -> [stMATIC / bb-a-WMATIC]([link]) (Polygon) Adding STG/bb-a-USD Gauge (Ethereum) Pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Gauge: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Transaction: To allow time for emissions to move over and all LPs to get the full benefit of AURA emissions this BIP will be executed in two parts.

In addition, a new STG/bb-a-USD gauge will be activated and its predecessor added to the termination list, all in a bid to continue aligning incentives.
