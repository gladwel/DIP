As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need. With that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine. Abstract. Since inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraines conflict zone. Specifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here]([link]) These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items. Motivation. 1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible. Specification. 1. Swap 1,000,500 USDC to USDT within multi-sig on [1inch app]([link]) 2. Transfer 1,000,000 USDT from 1inch DAO Treasury multi-sig wallet to the official humanitarian wallet of Ukraine Due to exchange rates, a slightly higher amount of USDC is required to receive 1,000,000 USDT when swapping 1inch DAO Treasury address: [hexadecimals] Donation address: [hexadecimals] Rationale. This donation address has been [verified]([link]) by the crypto community as legitimate, and has been identified as having a direct impact on the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Ukraine. Considerations. With the 1inch DAO Treasurys historical rate of growth, the donation amount of 1 million USDC will have minimal impact on the DAOs ability to fund future developments of 1inch Network. At the same time, this amount will have a significant impact on the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine and its citizens.

This ARC proposes to freeze the Aave V3 Fantom market, allowing users to repay their debts and withdraw but blocking deposits and further borrowing on this market. After the Harmony bridge event and the recent Nomad bridge exploit, the aave community should consider the risk/benefits of keeping an active Aave V3 market on fantom as this network is dependent of anyswap (multichain) bridge. The Fantom Aave V3 market did not gain noticeable traction with a current market size of 9M$ and 2.4M$ of open borrowing position, this led to a market generating on average 300$ of fees daily for the protocol (~30$ of daily fees for the Aave treasury) This market is not currently supported by the Aave Safety module and unless the Aave governance decides otherwise by specific vote, a failure of the main Bridge to Fantom will lead to users with assets worth 0. This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Fantom. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Famtom, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals, and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts. Motivation. The unbalanced risk/reward of keeping of Aave V3 market on Fantom is the motivation of this ARC, The risk of exposing users to potentially losing millions of $ due to causes exterior to intrinsic Aave security is considered not worth the 30$ of daily fees accrued by the Aave treasury.

[Blockchain at Berkeley]([link]) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad]([link]) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. Process Update. The [Temperature Check]([link]) for this proposal passed with 8.3M UNI voting Yes on the [Snapshot]([link]) We now move to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote. Summary. In support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap]([link]), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswaps trusted brand. About Moonbeam. Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadots XCM]([link]), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects]([link]) building DApps and protocols on the network. Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam. We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market  Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values  decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way. Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders. The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext]([link]) have already been deployed as Moonbeams main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance. Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance. Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap]([link]), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad]([link]) and [Connext]([link]) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance. We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap]([link]) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains. Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomads own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app]([link]) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored]([link]) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam. Rewards and Grants. As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal. To borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin]([link]) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \"bounties, hackathons, and grants for \"developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner. Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: - Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam. - Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users. - Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap. - Leveraging Substrates native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain. Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences. We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant! Conclusion. We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons: - Expansion into Polkadot: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeams EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeams position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. - Trust-minimized Governance: Per Uniswaps goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomads trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future. - Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswaps multi-chain presence. We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGB1uw5DgBd6qRywNDtvMT9kum", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Blockchain at Berkeley is proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, a Polkadot parachain, in order to expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem.

To achieve sustainability, Aave must combine value creation under favorable market conditions with protection of itself and its users when conditions become unfavorable [1] Aave must be able to lower the liquidation threshold of collateral assets to reduce the risk it and its users face under those adverse conditions. While loan-to-value and liquidation bonus are also useful means of reducing the risk of insolvency, they are not effective substitutes. Over the last several weeks, Gauntlet has collaborated with BGD Labs, Llama, Governance House, and other community stakeholders to align on how to most effectively serve the protocol regarding the tradeoffs between value creation and protection. Liquidation threshold reductions can impact users in a number of ways. In particular, if a users account health is low, this type of parameter change can render the account eligible for liquidation. If a user rebalances their position ahead of a liquidation threshold reduction, they will avoid liquidation. For this reason, Gauntlet will provide notice to the community via communication channels that may include the forums and Twitter, among others. That said, there is always some chance that a user will not monitor their health factor or fail to supply collateral in time, resulting in \"risk-off liquidations\" --- BGD, Llama, Governance House, and other community members have emphasized that these liquidations impinge on the borrower user experience. It is therefore important that the community explicitly aligns on a desired maximum reduction to liquidation thresholds per AIP. Community input is also valuable because limits on LT reduction impose an important trade-off: 1. A lower max LT reduction will minimize the impact to borrowers but at the cost of reducing the rate at which risk can be taken off. This, in turn, limits the extent to which leverage can be increased during favorable conditions, making Aave less capital efficient and coming at the cost of borrow volume. 2. A higher max LT reduction will strengthen Aaves ability to maximize capital efficiency under favorable market conditions but increase the potential for risk-off liquidations. --- The options for this Snapshot vote are the following: Per AIP, each collateral assets liquidation threshold may be reduced by an absolute percentage of up to: 3% (see point (2) above) 2% 1% (see point (1) above) 0% (no risk management) Abstain. Note: This limit would not apply under severe conditions, such as a contract vulnerability. It would apply to all collateral assets Gauntlet supports, including WETH, WBTC, DAI, &c.

Uniswap has already changed the world. In only 3 years, the worlds first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than $1T 7 in cumulative volume, and served millions of users 4 worldwide. Its daily volume today is on par with Coinbase 10. Ownership of the protocol was transferred to the community 12 in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 22 improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling. However, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects. We want to change that. Today, we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community. In other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support you. Uniswaps community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more. The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future. It will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem. It will help you make an impact  to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts. We believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet. It brought the automated market maker to the masses. It has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3. It is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure  constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our worlds financial infrastructure. But there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential. We're excited to work with all of you to make that happen. If you're excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - @devinawalsh and @nkennethk are open), and spread the word. Uniswap Foundation Proposal. This proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal. TL;DR. Today, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation (UF) Scope: The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocols decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate. Team: Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12. Budget: To fund these efforts, we are requesting: A $14M Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years. A $60M expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years. We are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of $20M. Governance Participation: We are also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser 40, this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance. Uniswap Foundation. Mission. In pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem. Key Activities and OKRs. We have listed our starting OKRs below. Its possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community. Growth: Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Governance: Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Advocacy: Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact. ![OKR [image]]([link]) Optimism Phase 0 token distribution link here 6. Year 1 Roadmap. Our roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities: ![Year [image]]([link]) Optimism Collective community Constitution link here. Team. Devin Walsh 108, Executive Director (ED) As ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UFs strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision. Devin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MITs Digital Currency Initiative, worked on decentralized identity at uPort (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at CoinFund. She has consulted with Edge & Node and cLabs, and led MIRA, a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF. Ken Ng 69, Head of Operations. As Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UFs impact. Ken has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the Uniswap Grants Program 1 for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program, which gave Hayden his initial grant 7 to build Uniswap. He served as COO of Slingshot Finance and cofounder of his nonprofit eduDAO, which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx. The needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first: ![[image]]([link]) Applications are open today! Check out job descriptions here. As noted by Other Internet 4, there is also a need for new structures to \"facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives. Advisors. The Foundations initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals: Jesse Walden, Founder and GP, Variant. Julia Rosenberg, Co-Founder, Orca Protocol. Alexis Gauba, Co-Founder, Opyn; Co-Founder, she256. Hart Lambur, Co-Founder of UMA. In addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations, Provide input on UFs initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members. Become temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired. Board. Devin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UFs Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations. Budget. We are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets: $60M for Uniswap Grants Program. Grants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful. We are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this retrospective 22), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work. ![[image]]([link]) We are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are: A version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet. A prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space. We are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons. To ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M. We believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining. $14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years. In order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below) Budget estimate looking forward three years is below. ![[image]]([link]) Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year. The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation. Fund Disbursements. An approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested. We are requesting the funds in two disbursements: $20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $7.04, this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI. $54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement. To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $7.04 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/3/2022. Governance Participation. The UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance. These tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals. The Franchiser was developed by Noah Zinsmeister and was audited by Trail of Bits. Next Steps. We are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check. Additionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Mon., August 15.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nWhat is Pocket Network: Pocket is a decentralized RPC protocol with a permissionless network of over 45.000 incentivized nodes. This gives us the best resilience in the market with latency comparable to leading centralized providers, while being decentralized. Dapps that use Pocket Networks RPC get to own their service and the more they use it, the cheaper it gets. As opposed to other providers, rather than paying a monthly fee that is a recurring cost, Dapps using Pocket get allocated RPC service based on a POKT stake, which allows them to own their infra in a liquid way. By using Pocket, Aave will be actively incentivizing decentralization as the more traffic is served by the network, more rewards are generated, causing more nodes to be spun up for the chains in question. Rationale: We have learned that Aave currently uses a basket of public RPCs for servicing the end user relays. Team members have expressed the desire to improve this solution as it is not very stable and there are recurring problems in service from these different public RPCs. This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs. By providing Pocket Endpoints to Aaves user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level (both latency and % uptime) and contribute to Aaves decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake. We have developed a contract and method based permissioning method that will be implemented for AAVEs endpoint, so that it can only be used to interact with AAVE protocol. Proposal: We believe a good start is to provide this service with an app stake thats good for 25M relays (won't get rate limited if exceeded) and later ramp up depending on performance, user feedback and how much the DAO is willing to invest. Pocket Network would stake 118,815 POKT on behalf of AAVE DAO. This would be funded as follows: Budget: 25M Relays: $POKT 118,815. $POKT price at time of posting: $0.138 USD per POKT. Total: $16,396.47 USD. Goals: 1) Improve stability in Aaves public facing Web3 infrastructure. 2) Decentralization of Aaves front end RPC. 3) Give Aave ownership of its RPC service via owning the POKT token. 4) Further promote decentralization in the Aave and crypto communities. 5) Raise awareness of Pockets service and mission to decentralize web3 infra. 6) Encourage other projects to decentralize their infra with Pocket Network. Milestones: 1) Integration: Integration of Aave with Pocket via inclusion of a simple URL addition. 2) Onboarding/Testing: Testing of the Pocket Network endpoint. Tech support provided by Pocket engineers. 3) Ramp up: Allocation of a certain % (equivalent to 25M Relays) of Aave traffic to Pocket Network. 4) Increase of % and Pokt stake if service is performing as desired; Proposal content in short. We propose an addition of Aaves frontend RPCs to Pocket Network, in order to solve stability problems currently experienced in the use of public RPCs (especially on mainnet), as expressed by the community. We are offering an endpoint with a stake for 25M relays that won't get rate limited and to be ramped up in a phased manner. To fund this we are asking the AAVE community the funds to buy 118,815 $POKT which will represent their service stake, allowing for AAVE to send up to 25M Relays per day.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODHHqCJ8Z4WN0Oxmk77PLMyUhDv", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953927, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pocket Network is a decentralized system that provides reliable and fast RPC services for blockchain applications.

This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors. We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [PG twitter account]([link]) Context. 1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - \"Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting]([link]) current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ![0xsplits [image]]([link]) PG Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc) The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO]([link]), and the [vote]([link]) ([forum post]([link])) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. Proposal. We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guilds vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022]([link])), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community: Uniswaps long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients. Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework. Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. Next Steps. If this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGCOiU6EE57z4Qsj7YJxKtfbDl", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that the Uniswap community allocate 500k UNI tokens (equivalent to around $2.5 million) to support the ongoing work of core contributors to the Ethereum protocol through the Protocol Guild.

Simple Summary. In response to Tribe DAOs proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Abstract. Tribe DAO is dissolving the DAOs assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI. As FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEIs circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market. In response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO. This proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn. Motivation. With the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state. The details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here]([link]) As FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets. Specification. The recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. Risk Parameters: Freeze the FEI market which will: Borrowing Enabled  Disable. Lending Enabled  Disable. Also, Reserve Factor 20%  100% Next Steps. The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the earliest 24th August 2022, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date 29th August 2022.

This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch Network DAO Treasurys revenue collection strategy by enacting the following changes: Switch from buying USDC with Swap Surplus revenue to buying 1INCH when the price is lower than $1.30. Switch from buying 1INCH with Swap Surplus revenue to buying USDC the price of 1INCH is greater than or equal to $1.70. Abstract. Currently, the Swap Surplus [revenue stream]([link]) is collected in varying tokens and swapped to [USDC]([link]) before it is then sent to the 1inch DAO [Treasury]([link]) Once enacted, this proposal will instead swap these tokens to [1INCH]([link]) as long as the market price of 1INCH is below the $1.30 to $1.70 range (see the Specification section for a detailed explanation) All swaps will be done using the [1inch Aggregation Protocol]([link]) to ensure the best pricing. Motivation. Benefits to the 1inch Network DAO include: Investing the DAOs revenue stream into the protocols governance token while the governance token is lower than it was previously valued. Potential upward pressure on the 1INCH token as the DAO Treasury will be a net buyer of cheap 1INCH. When the token is trading at higher valuations, the Treasury will automatically de-risk by collecting revenue in stable coins. Holding 1INCH within the 1inch DAO Treasury will allow the Treasury to scale its value with the performance of the token. Specification. This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the fee collection strategy with the following changes: When the price of 1INCH moves is below $1.30, Swap Surplus revenue shall start to be collected in 1INCH. When the price of 1INCH moves above $1.70, Swap Surplus revenue shall be collected in USDC. Once the modifications have been made and tested, 1inch Labs shall deploy them. All future modifications to these will need to be done by a 1inch DAO Governance vote. Rationale. This proposal aims to purchase 1INCH with treasury revenue when the price is lower than ~$1.50. $0.20 bands are used on either side of this buying point in order to dampen the impact that market volatility could have. This price point of 1INCH that triggers the switch can be changed in the future via a governance vote. Considerations. Market Risk. The USDC stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury puts the Treasury in a very good position during any bearish market cycles  the Treasury constantly grows in dollar value while, in contrast, projects that primarily hold their own token, have had the real value of their Treasury shrink in the last 6 months. Adding 1INCH to the Treasury composition will increase both the potential risk and potential returns. This proposal dampens the volatility by maintaining a mix of risk-on and risk-off assets. Added Complexity. If enacted, this proposal will add complexity to the Treasury Revenue collection strategy.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGCLQRXS3WwzryxRN4QLlBQkKb", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests changing the way the 1inch Network DAO Treasury collects revenue.

This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH. These parameter updates also represent Gauntlets first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Our recent [market downturn report]([link]) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | LINK Loan To Value | 70% | 67% | | LINK Liquidation Bonus | 6.3% | 5.0% | | LINK Liquidation Threshold | 78% | 75% | | WBTC Loan To Value | 70% | 69% | | WBTC Liquidation Bonus | 6.5% | 5.0% | | WBTC Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 76% | | WETH Loan To Value | 82.5% | 81% | | WETH Liquidation Bonus | 5.0% | 4.0% | | WETH Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 83% | See below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26.

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | USDC Loan To Value | 85.5% | 87.5% | | USDC Liquidation Threshold | 88% | 90% | Risk Dashboard.

[Rage Trade]([link]) is a new perpetual swap protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp. Why do we need an additional use grant? Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswaps core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. What changes have we made that require additional use? We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswaps BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for): - [SimulateSwap]([link]): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswaps TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries. - [TickBitmapExtended]([link]): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswaps TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract. - [TickExtended]([link]): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3. - [LiquidityPosition]([link]): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic) It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so. How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap? 1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3. 2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curves tricrypto. 3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. Conclusion. Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswaps value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGAWRbDLnQpico1k2vrsFFW167", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rage Trade is a new perpetual swap protocol built on Uniswap v3, which provides concentrated liquidity and allows for leverage trading.

A proposal to pause ETH borrowing in the period leading up to the Ethereum Merge. In addition, the original forum post also proposed transferring a one-time payment of 60 AAVE from the Aave treasury to the MakerDAO pause proxy in connection to the [proposal]([link]) In this Snapshot vote, we also provide the options to vote for this payment. Abstract. Ahead of the Ethereum Merge, the Aave protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate this risk of high utilization. Motivation. Full details are provided in the original [forum post]([link]) The risk of high utilization in the ETH market is driven by users potentially benefiting from the forked PoW ETH (ETHW) by borrowing ETH before the merge. High utilization interferes with liquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol. In addition, a high ETH borrow rate can make stETH/ETH recursive positions unprofitable, increasing the chances that users unwind their positions and drive the stETH/ETH price deviation further, causing additional liquidations and insolvency. Specification Calling 'disableBorrowingOnReserve' to disable ETH borrowing. The options for this Snapshot vote are as follows: 1. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and pay 60 AAVE tokens. 2. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and decide on payment later.

This proposal seeks to diversify the 1inch Network DAOs Treasury composition be enacting the following strategy: Do not exchange a whitelisted set of tokens for USDC before sending to the 1inch DAO Treasury. These whitelisted tokens shall be: ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT. Abstract. Currently, all of the Swap Surplus revenue stream is collected in varying tokens and swapped to USDC before being sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury. To start the diversification process of the treasury funds, the protocol can keep some incoming Swap Surplus tokens as collected (not swapping them for USDC) This proposal aims to whitelist the following tokens for this treasury collection strategy: ETH WETH WBTC DAI USDT. Motivation. The 1inch DAO Treasury is 100% composed of USDC. USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD managed by Circle. USD experienced record inflation over the last 12 months, and will experience some degree of inflation for perpetuity. As such, the marginal spending power of the 1inch DAO Treasury is weakened unless the DAO deploys the funds in a manner that can outpace inflation. These assets are viewed as risk-on diversification assets for the treasury: ETH  the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain WETH  ETH wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper WBTC  Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest and largest digital asset. WBTC is Bitcoin wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper. Stablecoins also have inherent risks such as smart contract risks and centralization risks. Diversifying the stable coin holdings of the 1inch DAO Treasury aims to hedge against these risks. These assets are viewed as risk-off assets for the treasury: DAI  the decentralized collateral-backed stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol. DAI is soft-pegged to USD USDT  the fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD and managed by Tether. Specification. To implement this proposal, GovernanceLeftoverExchanger should transfer ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI and USDT directly to the treasury the same way it transfers USDC. All other tokens should still be converted to USDC as they are now. Rationale. The crypto market cap took a decline in recent months. With token valuations depressed, it may be a good time to start accumulating non-stable tokens to grow the treasury. Since exchange transactions cost some Ether to pay for the gas fees, eliminating the swapping step for these whitelisted tokens will increase the capital efficiency of this operation. It is also for this reason that large stable coins such as DAI and USDT, should be sent directly to the treasury. Considerations. The current stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury ensures that the Treasury is insulated from bearish market cycles. However, this also means the treasurys funds have no way to keep pace with the rise in inflation. Adding ETH, WETH and WBTC increase both the risk and the potential rewards. This proposal does not call for any actions to be taken with the funds currently held by the 1inch DAO Treasury.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODG6hIjscw2hSYpQ1KwVTEqHIUT", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests diversifying the 1inch Network DAOs Treasury by collecting certain tokens instead of converting them to USDC.

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested. Abstract. The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. Its a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection. As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection. Motivation. The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2. Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers. Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets. The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax) With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance. These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period. Specification. The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO. ![Screenshot]]([link]) Voting. FOR Avalanche: DO extend the coverage to Aave V2 Avalanche.

After passing the [Temperature Check vote]([link]) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), we are creating this post to move forward into the Consensus Check stage. Comments on [the previous post]([link]) expressed support for v3 deployment on GC, but also suggested more clarity on the following topics: The team that will be deploying Uniswap v3 on GC The bridge used to facilitate cross-chain governance for Uniswap v3 on GC The details of liquidity incentives provided, including timelines and logistics for transferring funds. We have updated this post accordingly and provided more details on each of these items. About Gnosis Chain. In production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain]([link]) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates. Tuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet. Proposal. The Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to \"accelerate Ethereum, Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include: 1. A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [[link]]([link]) 2. An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc) Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration. 3. Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works]([link]) The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set]([link]) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain. The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment. 4. Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability. 5. User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3. The $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn't have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad. Since the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we've also seen the [Nomad]([link]) teams proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam]([link]), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments. In the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we've partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain. We believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it: [Supports generalized messages]([link]) between chains Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs. Nomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules]([link]) as part of its governance stack. We are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Timeline. Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain. Proposal Acceptance and Execution. As the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet. Conclusion. The Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund]([link]) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth. We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback!

The proposals goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 1m sAVAX supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here ([link]) Reasons for increase: DEX Liquidity and Conversion Rate: Despite market conditions, DEX liquidity has remained around $40m across Platypus, TraderJoe and Pangolin. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary. However, at the time of writing, there has not been any necessary liquidations of sAVAX on AAVE. As Liquid Staked AVAX, there exists a pseudo peg to AVAX on secondary markets such as Platypus. Due to the nature of the asset, the conversion rate of sAVAX:AVAX has been quite closely maintained due to natural price arbitrage and a 15-days redemption window. LTV and E-mode: sAVAX has a modest LTV on normal mode, at 20%, where there exists a healthy spread of price deviation to facilitate liquidations if necessary. On E-mode, only AVAX can be borrowed against sAVAX, which is a highly correlated asset with healthy liquidity on DEXs. Maturing Asset: The cap was initially set as it was a deployment of a new pool. sAVAX has been listed for more than 2 weeks (listed 30th June 2022) and has been near supply cap since. As an asset, sAVAX is relatively mature, having launched in February 2022 and having undergone tumultuous market conditions and stress testing.

This proposal seeks to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol. Specifically, it calls for the following additions: Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API The first derivative supported will be Opiums TURBO products (call options) Abstract. This proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol  specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation. Motivation. 1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: the aggregation of derivative products. By implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity) Specification. This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API. Opiums TURBO product is a short-dated call option: Community / users can \"write covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums) Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. Adding Opiums TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration. Rationale. The architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined. Opiums TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs. Considerations. The specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on mainnet.

We propose that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop]([link])) be allocated in recognition of past and ongoing work of these core contributors. ENS is one of the most successful projects built on Ethereum, and yet core protocol contributors do not benefit in any way from the success of projects being built on Ethereum. The Protocol Guild provides a vehicle for the ENS community to distribute governance tokens to those individuals who build and maintain the foundational infrastructure that ENS relies on. ENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Specification. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Split Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [Protocol Guild twitter]([link]) Context. 1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all, \"Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow to 150 over the course of the Pilot. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ![|602x387]([link]]) 2022 Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round for longer vesting periods. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Proposal. We are proposing that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop]([link])) be sent to the [Pilot vesting contract]([link]) deployed at [hexadecimals]f1a9 in recognition of the past and ongoing work of these core contributors. The tokens would not be liquidated, but would vest for one year to each beneficiary listed on the underlying split. Each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. The USD value of the 200k ENS is $2.49mm as of the time of this post on May 25 2022. This is roughly in line with what we have already proposed to similarly prominent Ethereum-based protocols. [Lidos 2mm LDO contribution]([link]) was worth $2.6mm; the [active Uniswap proposal]([link]) requesting 500k UNI would be worth $2.75mm. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the ENS community: ENSs long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients. Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to ENS allows protocol contributors to engage more with ENS governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to delegate them within the ENS governance framework. ENS should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the ENS communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. We hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between the ENS community and the Protocol Guild as we scale up the project after the Pilot. To that end, we think its important to demonstrate impact: learn more about how we intend to evaluate [Pilot outcomes here]([link]) We have also adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we operate the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, better transparency, etc. Transactions. <table> <tr> <th>Address</th> <th>Value</th> <th>Function</th> <th>Argument</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan=2>token.ensdao.eth</td> <td rowspan=2>0</td> <td rowspan=2>transfer</td> <td>recipient</td> <td>theprotocolguild.eth</td> </tr> <tr> <td>amount</td> <td>200000000000000000000000</td> </tr> </table>\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODHEEVigXn1jGzeLtq1sW68Mk0f", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953927, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests allocating 200k ENS tokens to core contributors of the Protocol Guild, a group of individuals who work on maintaining and improving the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol. Motivation. The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens) The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol]([link]) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset) We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocols design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave. When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RTokens full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now. Specifications. Link between the author & the project: The Reserve team. High level overview of the project: The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+ cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them. ![image]([link]) The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily ([link]) The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc) A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RTokens collateral. We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s) Why would RSR be a good borrow asset? We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield. These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don't expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform. Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand. By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties. Brief history of the projects components. The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol. The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later. An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve]([link]) How is the asset currently used? At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes: 1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens. 2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc) Emission schedule. The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors. The [Slow Wallet]([link]) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. Its under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks. More details here: [Release schedule]([link]) Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply) The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig]([link]), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

Summary. Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there. At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero. There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap]([link]) and on [Curve]([link]) Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite. Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism. The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave) The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

Audits. We have had four different audits which can be found [here]([link]) Benefits for Aave V3. agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg. One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the  and short the $ through agEUR. Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the . This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future. Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, theres also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment. Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole. Risk Parameters. With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters. V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon.

How is the asset currently used? The asset is a  stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere. It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi 6. Emission schedule Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. Theres no emission schedule for the token. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do?

This proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools]([link]) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Abstract. This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following. 1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. 2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote. 3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs. Motivation. Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum]([link]) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call 02]([link]) Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs. Specification. At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancers BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancers BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancers BatchSwap function. We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1: 1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL. 2. bbfUSD, [expected]([link]) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI. This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO. Upon satisfactory integration <sup>Note1</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: [hexadecimals] Note 1: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user. Rationale. Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancers Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well. Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched. This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration. Considerations. The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net. Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGKqYvZRC9UhLbHToY0yC8mMRW", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests integrating Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested. Abstract. The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. Its a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection. As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection. Motivation. The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2. Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers. Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets. The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax) With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance. These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period. Specification. The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO. ![Screenshot]]([link]) Voting. FOR Aave V2 Arc: DO extend the coverage to Aave V2 Arc Market.

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave. Motivations. Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Networks metrics are below (source 1): Total trading volume: $160B. Total swaps: 5.91M. Total users: 1.25M. 1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange. The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4. In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors. Benefits to Aave Community. 1INCH is highly liquid. 1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage. 1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? 1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space. 1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling. On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. 1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time. 1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running. 1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency. P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token. 1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions. Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. How is the asset currently used? 1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO. Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3. Emission schedule. The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4. Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached) Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply) Token & protocol permissions and upgradability. The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded  new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance. The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The tokens mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4  there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately. 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig. Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs. 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing. 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals. st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocols governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100% There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively. v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH. The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAOs treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M. The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing. The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value. On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH. There is an extensive list of audits available on Github. Relevant addresses are linked below: Audits: [link] 1inch Genesis: [hexadecimals] Burn 1INCH Key Transaction: [hexadecimals] 1INCH Counterparty Risk: 1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed. Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. The st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility. Users who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAOs treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAOs Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.

Full details at: [link] Kyber Network is a multi-chain crypto trading and liquidity hub that connects liquidity from different sources to enable token trading at the best rates through its main user interface [KyberSwap.com]([link]) As a hybrid DEX aggregator + liquidity platform, it aims to offer the best rates for traders and the best returns for liquidity providers with concentrated liquidity. Kyber Network launched on Ethereum in February 2018 and is a pioneer in the DeFi space, developing one of the earliest decentralized exchanges (DEX) with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. The team has continued to innovate; spearheading the launch of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin today, as well as developing amplified liquidity pools on KyberSwap that offers capital efficiency for any token pair. Kyber Network is also part of the pioneer batch of Alliance DAO/DeFi Alliance mentors. This proposal aims to list the new version of the [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token]([link]) for borrowing and lending and as a collateral asset on both Aave v2 and v3, after [delisting]([link]) the old KNCL token (previously on Aave) Motivations. KyberSwap (Kyber Networks main swap interface) is one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with close to [1M web visitors per month]([link]) (June 2022) KyberSwap has already been deployed on 12 chains. Total trading volume has crossed $10B+ (combined legacy and new KyberSwap protocol) and current total value locked (TVL) is $63M+ KNC is Kybers utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. KNC is a liquid asset with many token holders. KNC holders may want to obtain additional liquidity without selling KNC so that they can still capture potential upside in value. With KNC supported on Aave, KNC holders can borrow funds for a wide variety of DeFi use cases, such as margin trading or for new investment opportunities, all without selling their current holdings. Specifications. 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? [shaneMkt]([link]) is Head of Strategy for DAO & Tokenomics at Kyber Network. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token About Kyber Network Kyber Network is a multi-chain crypto trading and liquidity hub that connects liquidity from different sources to enable token trading at the best rates through its main user interface KyberSwap.com. As a hybrid DEX aggregator + liquidity platform, it aims to offer the best rates for traders and the best returns for liquidity providers. Kybers vision is to be the multi-chain liquidity hub for the decentralized economy, where any user or application can easily access the required tokens for their liquidity needs. About KNC KNC is Kybers utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on [KyberDAO]([link]) proposals. Important proposals include improvements to KyberSwap, determining the various incentive mechanisms for liquidity providers, and capturing value created by new innovations. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. KNC investors include: Hashed, Signum, ParaFi, HyperChain, and Stake Capital. KNC Migration in 2021 The old KNCL token was previously approved and added to Aave. In 2021, KNC was upgraded to add additional utility and upgradeability. The old KNC was renamed KNCL (Kyber Network Crystal Legacy) to differentiate it from the new KNC. Since 20 April, 2021, users can migrate their KNCL (ie. convert it) to new KNC through a simple procedure on [Kyber.org]([link]) Top exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on decentralized platforms such as KyberSwap.com as well as centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Crypto.com, OKX, KuCoin, Kraken, Huobi, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bithumb, Upbit, WazirX, and eToro. New KNC Announcement: [[link] 1]([link]) Migration Guide: [KNC Token Migration Guide]([link]) There was also recent [ARC proposal by Gauntlet]([link]) to freeze KNCL (the old legacy token) to make way for the new KNC token on Aave. 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? Kyber Network is a well-known DeFi project and KNC one of the top tokens selected to be part of the [DeFi Pulse Index]([link]) According to DeFi Pulse, for the top DeFi tokens that were selected, the \"associated dApp and founding team must be widely considered legitimate. KNC governs one of the most popular DEX aggregators and liquidity protocols in DeFi which is deployed on 12 chains KNC is a highly liquid token but is still not on many decentralized lending platforms [KNC price feeds]([link]) are supported by Chainlink on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. ![image]([link]) KNC is already a supported asset on the bridges for BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism KNC has over 10,000 token holders, including crypto VCs and other DeFi projects If it is added to Aave, KNC holders would be able to lend KNC to earn interest instead of selling their tokens By supporting deposits of KNC as collateral, users can borrow stablecoins for other activities KNC holders can borrow KNC for staking and earning rewards, and support governance proposals Kyber team and KyberDAO treasury are considering depositing KNC to borrow stablecoins The old KNCL token had earlier passed Aaves due diligence and was supported as collateral on Aave Risk Matrix 6 Sep 2022 ![image]([link]) [KyberDAO and KNC audit by Hacken]([link]) [KyberSwap audit by ChainSecurity]([link]) Benefits to the Aave Community New KNC is highly liquid but it is not on any major decentralized lending platform. Aave can be the first to support it. Kyber has a large community on our social media channels and can provide marketing support and resources to promote the launch of new KNC on Aave, thereby spreading more awareness about Aave. KNC has over 10,000 token holders, including VCs and other DeFi projects, and they would be able to have a direct use case for their tokens on Aave. Kyber is expanding to a wide variety of chains (already on 12 chains), which is aligned with and can support Aaves expansion efforts to other chains Kyber and Aave have a long history of collaboration and listing new KNC would be another positive step forward in our relationship. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Kyber Network was founded by Victor Tran, Loi Luu, and Yaron Velner in 2017; all 3 founders are well-known researchers in the Ethereum and DeFi community, and Victor and Loi were both Forbes 30 under 30 recipients. Yaron is also the founder of [B.Protocol]([link]) and [Risk DAO]([link]) Since inception, Kyber Network has powered 100+ integrated projects and successfully facilitated over $10 billion in transactions and over a million trades for thousands of users. For example, our main product KyberSwap integrated with leading trading analytics platform [DEXTools]([link]), enabling millions of users to access KyberSwaps token pairs at the best rates. KyberSwap.com currently supports 12 chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Arbitrum, Optimism, Velas, Aurora, Oasis and BitTorrent. Aggregated TVL from 67+ DEXes is over $40B, with 30,000+ pools and 26,000+ tokens. Historical milestones 1. One of the earliest DEXes and it was developed with advice from Vitalik Buterin. 2. Built [Oyente]([link]), which was the first automated smart contract verification framework and one of the most used open-source auditing tools by security experts (e.g. Enzyme, Quantstamp) 3. One of the first to use DEX/liquidity pool aggregation on Ethereum by integrating different DEXes. 4. Initiated and launched [WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)]([link]) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin. 5. Developed practical decentralized cross-chain bridges between Ethereum and a non-EVM chain (Peace Relay for Bitcoin and Waterloo Bridge for EOS, which inspired the Rainbow bridge for NEAR) 6. First to work with professional market makers for on-chain market making on Ethereum. 7. Helped advise and was part of the launch of DeFi Alliance and Asia DeFi Network. 8. First to develop amplified pools with high capital efficiency for any token pair, not just stablecoins. 11. One of the few hybrid DEX aggregators that not only have our own permissionless liquidity pools, but also sources liquidity from external sources to give the best rates to traders Recent KyberSwap Features 1. DEX Aggregation Algorithm. KyberSwaps aggregation algorithm aggregates liquidity, automatically searching multiple DEXes to identify and select the optimal trade routes and best prices for users. KyberSwap makes trading more efficient and saves time and money for thousands of users. KyberSwap sources liquidity from over 60 different DEXs such as Uniswap, Sushi, Curve, QuickSwap, Pancakeswap, Traderjoe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, VVS Finance and many others to achieve the best rates for traders on supported chains. 2. Concentrated/Amplified Liquidity Pools. Elastic Pools: Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit tokens into Elastic pools and earn compounding fees. Pools have customizable price ranges and features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity , mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving much better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. For example, with the same pool and trade size, stable token pairs with low variability in the price range (e.g. USDC/USDT) can be up to 1000x better compared to other platforms. As such, liquidity providers can achieve greater capital efficiency, rates, volume, and returns compared to other platforms. LPs earn more in an efficient manner. Moreover, LPs earn trading fees that are automatically claimed when you withdraw your liquidity. 3. Trending Soon Analytics. KyberSwap users can view which tokens are [Trending' and Trending Soon']([link]) Tokens displayed under the Trending tab are based on current trending data gleaned from top data aggregators CoinGecko and Coinmarket. Tokens displayed under Trending Soon are detected based on Kybers special trend detection algorithm, using trading volume, price, market cap, and other on-chain data. 5. How is the asset currently used? KNC is Kybers utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on [KyberDAO]([link]) proposals. Important proposals include improvements to KyberSwap, determining the various incentive mechanisms for liquidity providers, and capturing value created by new innovations. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. Over $10M worth of rewards have been distributed to KyberDAO voters over the years. More information about KNC can be found here: [link] 6. Emission schedule. There is currently no automatic emission. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019. ~23M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities. New KNC can be minted or burned by KyberDAO, subject to a DAO vote by KNC holders. 7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability. KNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aaves governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the current KNC staking model. KNC is dynamic and can be upgraded, minted, or burned by KyberDAO to better support liquidity and growth. The DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi projects with no direct affiliation to Kyber. Reached text limit.

This is a proposal to add GNO, the Gnosisdaos governance token, as collateral in the Aave v2 protocol. Gnosisdao is a collective that uses GNO to transparently guide decisions on the development of Gnosis products. It has produced solutions which are widely adopted in our ecosystem, such as the Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet, Zodiac (DAO tooling consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards architecture), Gnosis Auction (a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized batch auctions) and Cowswap (which allows anyone to buy and sell tokens using gas-less orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users or into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection), among others. The GNO token allows its holders to be validators and boost their rewards on the Gnosis Chain network (formerly the xDai Chain) The Gnosis Chain provides stability and scalability. It is a stable EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The Gnosis Chain currently has a TVL of $290M, with 130k+ transactions a day, an average block time of 5 seconds, and holds over 6.1M wallets. Useful Links. Gnosis Chain: EVM 2.

Specifications. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? Karpatkey DAO provides treasury management solutions for DAOs and currently manages Gnosis DAOs treasury initiatives. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. Please refer to the summary above. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? GNOs liquidity is comparable or better than the top 3 DeFi protocol tokens listed on Aave by total supply (AAVE, LINK and MKR) This means it can be sold at large quantities with lower price impact, resulting in a better quality collateral for liquidations. Also, a more liquid asset tends to be less volatile than an illiquid one. The GnosisDAO community and treasury would be the main interested parties in depositing GNO and borrowing stablecoins, increasing the Ethereum Reserve Factor. It would set a good precedent to continue working with other GnosisDAO products for tighter Aave integrations, like v3 for Gnosis Chain and Safe apps for multisig users. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin Koppelmann and Stefan George under ConsenSys, an Ethereum venture production studio. On 23-Nov-2020 GnosisDAO was born, a prediction market-driven collective, stewarding the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy: governance by prediction markets. Gnosis' products are the following: Gnosis Auction: Gnosis Auction is a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized token price discovery. Batch auctions set the price exactly where supply and demand meet. This ensures the same fair price for all participants. Also, timed batches protect the users from frontrunning. Zodiac 1: a collection of tools for DAOs, built according to an open standard, which enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs. Conditional Tokens Framework: powering decentralized prediction markets like the Omen platform. Gnosis Protocol V2: leveraging batch auctions to offer MEV protection, plus integration with liquidity sources across DEXs to provide traders with the best prices. Within the Gnosis Protocol V2, the proof-of-concept CowSwap DEX was born, as well as the Balancer-Gnosis partnership integration, aiming to build a stable version of GPv2 on top of the Balancer V2 vault. Gnosis Safe: The most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum, with over 107 billion USD worth of digital assets securely stored. It has web, desktop and mobile versions.

Description. This is a proposal to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022 in accordance with rule 3.1 of the working group rules passed under [EP 4]([link]) If this proposal is passed, the Community Working Group will be dissolved at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, leaving three remaining working groups within the ENS DAO: 1. Meta-Governance Working Group; 2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group; and. 3. Public Goods Working Group. On the basis that new working groups cannot be formed within the DAO unless it can shown that \" the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group (rule 2.2), the same standard should apply for the dissolution of working groups. After consulting with Stewards and Community Working Group participants, regarding their work and experiences during the First Term of 2022, it is clear that: 1. each subgroup within the Community Working Group could comfortably fall within the Ecosystem Working Group; and. 2. the DAO does not have enough active participants to justify having \"community\" as a standalone working group. Therefore, using the same standard set out in rule 2.2, we should dissolve the Community Working Group and migrate all existing subgroups from that working group to the Ecosystem Working Group or another working group as appropriate. By dissolving the Community Working Group, the remaining working groups will have distinct mandates that provide clarity for contributors, without overlap. This will allow stewards to more efficiently facilitate work within the remaining working groups. Please note. There is currently an election taking place on Snapshot to elect Community Working Group Stewards for the Second Term.

Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham. Created: 21-08-2022. Simple Summary. In response to Tribe DAOs proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. Abstract. The Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin. If other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority. After redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee. Motivation. The FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35]([link]) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only [9,033,330.80]([link]) units of FEI held within the lending market. Fei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35]([link]) > available liquidity [9,033,330.80]([link]) This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders. The market currently supports [11,308,536.17]([link]) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80]([link]) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80]([link]) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish. Aave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans. This proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events. Once the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community]([link]) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here]([link]) In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds. Specification. The below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed. All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI. All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM. If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Next Steps. The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the earliest 25th August 2022, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date 29th August 2022.

Transak was previously integrated with Aave UI(Fiat  aTokens on Aave) The purpose of this proposal is to add it to allow users in over 100+ countries across multiple blockchain networks to buy cryptocurrencies in order to get a yield-earning token in their wallets. Details - Background. Transak was on Aave UI. Since Aave migration has happened to IPFS, Transak proposed to be added back on Aave to enable the community to on-ramp on all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed. About Transak. Transak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support. Goal. To integrate Transak Widget into Aave UI so that users can buy CryptoCurrencies against Fiat currencies using different payment methods on multiple blockchain networks. The Problem. Unfortunately, to start earning interest on tokens or borrowing funds, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with Aave. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching Aave. ![image]([link]) Solution & Benefit to the Aave Community. Allow Aave users to deposit more than 100+ cryptocurrencies with credit/debit card, Apple Pay, bank transfer, or the local payment method in more than 100+ countries and get yield-earning tokens in your wallet in 1 step with only 0.5% commission for bank transfer payments extremely competitively priced. Transak supports all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed and enables Aave users to access a supported DeFi in 1 step through Transaks 1-click to protocol solution. Now users only need to enter their wallet address and pay through their preferred payment method to use AAVE. Transaks 1-click to protocol solution hides the blockchain complexity and combines all five transactions into just one step for the user. ![image]([link]) How it Works. Using this integration, the user clicks on the buy Token button on the AAVE website to launch Transak Widget. Transak has its own smart contracts and when users deposit fiat it automatically mints yield-earning tokens and delivers them directly to their wallet. Transak takes all the complexity of whats going on and makes it simple for the user  fiat in requested cryptocurrency out to the users wallet.

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for Rocket Pools rETH on Aave. Motivation. Aave is a premier lending platform and basis for broader DeFi integration. The rETH token will offer many benefits to Aave if onboarded, just as rETH holders would benefit from making their assets more productive. The rETH token is important as a hedge against the risks of other ETH staking services (particularly because of its decentralized and permissionless nature) and will be an important addition to the DeFi space in general. Right now, Rocket Pool is bridging its rETH token across chains to make liquid staking more accessible for the masses - it is currently available in Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. As the second largest liquid staking token, Aave is missing a key asset in demand. Relevant Links. - Website: [link] - Dune Dashboard: [link] - Audits: - [link] - [link] - [link] - Documentation: [link] - Medium: [link] - Github Page: [link] - Communities: - [link] - [link] - [link] - MakerDAO Risk Evaluation: [link] - Aave Governance Discussion: [link] Specifications. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? I'm Marceau, an Aave lending participant and Rocket Pool community member. I care a lot about democratizing the liquid staking derivative marketplace and helping to bring options to the market for the health of the broader Ethereum network. Protocol Description. The Rocket Pool (RP) protocol is a decentralized Ethereum 2.0 Proof of Stake infrastructure service. Without staking pools, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions. Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service that lowers the wealth threshold. Abstracting staked ETH as rETH, participants can retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership) Unlike beacon chain ETH, rETH can be freely transferred and traded as it implements the ERC-20 interface. Further, unlike competing stETH by Lido, rETH passively gains value against ETH. This ratio is updated regularly by the oDAOan oracle DAO composed of major ecosystem players such as Etherscan, Bankless, Prysm, and more. Lido produces the stETH and wstETH tokens. The wstETH token acts just like rETH  allowing users to passively gain ETH staking rewards. The stETH-ETH Curve pool is one of the largest by TVL. However, the Lido network does not allow for permissionless node operators. All validators are hosted by a select set of nodes. As such, rETH provides decentralization support in a unique way. There are 2 primary users in RocketPool: rETH Stakers. Stakers can deposit as little as 0.01 ETH in exchange for rETH. rETH is a redemption token representing staked ETH. This token can be burnt at the Rocket Pool contract or website in exchange for ETH and accumulated staking reward. They do not need to run a machine. The returns are subject to a commission to node operators, which is a % of the staking rewards earned. Node Operators. Node Operators deposit 16 ETH, along with a minimum 1.6 ETH worth of RPL tokens as collateral to stake on behalf of the pool. This is permissionless, so anyone can run a node as long as they have the infrastructure and collateral. They will receive RPL inflation rewards, as well as ETH commission from the pool, along with staking rewards on their own 16 ETH. The rETH and stETH tokens price histories can be found roughly on coingecko, however, the most liquid price for rETH is found here 4 with the oracle price dictating the rETH deposit pool. Governance. Rocket Pool is governed by a dual DAO model. Responsibilities are split between the pDAO and the oDAO. The oDAOs primary responsibilities come from the fact that the consensus layer needs to interact with the execution layer. Some tasks include setting the protocol accepted RPL/ETH ratio as well as updating the exchange rate for rETH/ETH based on protocol results. Until recently, the oDAO was in bootstrap' mode allowing the Rocket Pool team to modify contracts and tweak parameters. This was removed and now the oDAO is self-governing between 14 members ([link]) The pDAO is yet to be released. Currently, the Rocket Pool team manages inflation destined for the pDAO. At some point in the future, these assets and control of adjustable parameters in the protocol will be turned over to this DAO. It is unclear if all RPL holders will be able to vote or if a sybil mechanism will be installed such as limiting votes to only staked RPL holders. These functions are controlled by bootstrap mode. The rETH token is available on numerous DEX contributing to a very stable peg. These diverse pools allow for a strong arbitrage market to keep the peg steady including the native deposit pool where rETH can be burned for the protocol oracle valuation against ETH. The Curve wstETH-rETH pool is the most liquid exchange of rETH and single largest holder of the asset. This pool has benefitted from high capital efficiency and charitable incentives. These are recently updated DeFi TVL metrics: - Alchemix (beta) WETH + rETH: $796,950 TVL. - Curve rETH + wstETH: $43.4 million TVL 6. - Balancer WETH + rETH: $15.3 million TVL. - Uniswap: $102,000 TVL. - Bancor: $334,000 TVL. - Yearn Curve rETH Vault: $1.3 million TVL 1. - Arbitrum - L1 ERC20 Gateway: $3.29 million TVL 1. - Optimism - Gateway: $2.29 million TVL. - Polygon (Matic) - ERC20 Bridge: $145,000 TVL 1. - zkSync: $359,000 TVL 1. Security Considerations. Rocketpool recently passed 6 months live on mainnet which is still fairly new for a protocol. Despite this, the protocol has not seen any down time nor experienced any major losses nor hacks. Rocket Pool also has an active bug bounty programme with Immuni.Fi and is looking to progressively increase the bounty with time. The protocol is susceptible to ETH execution risk on all major upgrades that involve the beacon chain. This includes potential complexity creep as SSV and MEV become core topics. There is governance risk between the oDAO and pDAO with the pDAO being more centrally controlled by the team bootstrap mode. The oDAO operates with majority consensus and so malicious attacks would require compromising many core Ethereum teams. Staking risk is low for rETH as slashing is insured against by Node Operator collateral and RPL stake. Proposed Risk Parameters. - LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH) - Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH) - Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH) - Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH) The proposed rETH risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH and are identical to the proposal by sETH2. ETH and rETH are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating rETH.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODH5bSQRu8VbD7z1rEfL1xOwu8F", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953927, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests adding borrow/lend support for Rocket Pool's rETH token on Aave, a popular lending platform in the DeFi space.

A proposal to whitelist deBridge, a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol, for Portals V3 on all chains where Aave v3 is deployed  with credit lines for USDC ($4M per chain), USDT ($4M per chain), and ETH (2000 ETH per chain) Overview [deBridge]([link]) is a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary data and assets between blockchains. The protocol is an infrastructure platform and framework for: - Cross-chain composability of smart contracts. - Cross-chain swaps (deSwap is one of the applications built on top of deBridge that enables capital-efficient cross-chain swaps) - Bridging of any arbitrary asset and data. - Interoperability and bridging of NFTs. In deBridge, we strongly believe in the concept of composable finance where a combination of different DeFi primitives or protocols enables solutions with the highest level of capital- efficiency that can't be achieved by standalone protocols or applications. deBridge was designed to be fully compatible with the existing DeFi ecosystem, and [deSwap]([link]) is a good example of this. It leverages deBridges generic messaging framework in order to provide users and protocols with the ability to perform a capital-efficient cross-chain conversion between arbitrary liquid assets, all in one transaction. More information about deSwap can be found [here]([link]) Instead of reinventing the wheel and developing a dedicated AMM or DEX, we integrated with Curve to utilize its capital-efficient stableswap AMM and partnered up and integrated with the liquidity aggregator 1inch. This design allows deSwap to source liquidity and routing from existing protocols. This is much more effective than running meaningless liquidity mining campaigns to have a ton of idle liquidity sitting as TVL with near-zero utilization. We truly believe its more reasonable to source liquidity from a protocol like AAVE when its needed and to do revenue sharing between the protocols. Portals enable a great synergy between deBridge and AAVE by bringing additional utilization for locked liquidity in AAVE as well as providing a new type of routing for cross-chain swaps through deSwap, where no intermediary pools or wrapped tokens are needed. In addition, the integration will facilitate atomic transfers of positions between Aave instances on different chains which ease cross-chain interactions with no need to switch wallets/networks. Technical Specifications. deBridge is an infrastructure for developers and projects to integrate with or use to build any type of cross-chain applications and primitives. The design of the deBridge protocol consists of two layers: Protocol layer  on-chain smart contracts deployed on every blockchain supported by deBridge. Infrastructure layer  off-chain validation nodes operated by validators that are elected by and work for deBridge governance. (List of active validators can be found [here]([link]) More details about the technical implementation and design of the deBridge protocol can be found in our [documentation portal]([link]) The protocol has been live since February and has processed over $45M in volume, 80k+ cross-chain transactions, 45k+ unique users, and generated over $120,000 in fees for the protocol and validators securing the network. The major activity in the protocol has been generated by deSwap, a cross-chain swap solution built on top of the deBridge generic messaging protocol. deSwap enables decentralized cross-chain conversion of arbitrary liquid assets. Here is some useful information: If applicable the number of routers, total liquidity of routers Cross-chain swaps are currently routed through the deUSDC/deETH liquidity pools at Curve protocol which have ~$9M of liquidity provided by deBridge users and partners. A complete list of liquidity pools can be found here: Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity - deBridge Is liquidity incentivized? At this moment liquidity is not incentivized. Liquidity providers receive 2 BPs in the form of trading fees from Curve. Anyone can provide liquidity to the protocol. Once control over the protocol is passed to governance, there is a plan to submit a governance proposal to the deBridge DAO to retroactively reward participants proportionally to how they have helped out the protocol in the early stages Is there a fee model for participants? The protocol takes a 10bps fee from every transaction (5bps go to validators and their delegators that help to secure the protocol, and another 5 bps go to deBridge treasury) Link to analytics dashboard of protocol: [link] Dune dashboard: [link] Bridge and cross-chain swaps for users: [link] Technical documentation: [link] At this stage cross-chain swaps are routed through the intermediary deUSDC pool at Curve which sets the maximal amount of swap being limited by liquidity in the pool ([link]) The credit line provided by Portals will solve this problem by enabling new routings and more capital-efficient cross-chain swaps with larger transactions, limited only by the amount of the credit line. One of the unique features of deBridge is the cross-chain \"transactions bundling\" where an arbitrary set of actions can be packed into one cross-chain interaction, e.g. users can do a cross-chain swap and supply the resulting liquidity to AAVE. The liquidity from Portals will be used in various scenarios: 1) Facilitate liquidity inflow into AAVE v3 on different chains so users can supply liquidity using any arbitrary asset on any chain supported by deBridge. 2) Let anyone automatically transfer positions across instances of AAVE v3 on different chains. 3) Utilized for routing of cross-chain swaps performed by users/protocols through deSwap. 4) Any applications and projects that integrate the [deSwap API]([link]) which will use Portals' liquidity bringing additional monetization to the AAVE protocol. We have prepared for the Aave community an application POC for swap + deposit into AAVE in a single transaction: [link] Once the deSwap widget is integrated into the AAVE application, all users of the AAVE UI will utilize liquidity of Portals to perform above-mentioned interactions with the protocol. This is an example of ETH liquidity routing on Ethereum which is converted into AVAX and supplied to AAVE on Avalanche: !([link]]) Once integrated with Portals, its credit line will be used instead of deUSDC. Technical implementation. Integration with Portals is to be performed through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract that will be developed by the deBridge team and audited by our security partner Halborn. This smart contract utilizes the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with Portals (AAVE Pools) It receives liquidity from the user, then redeems the loan on one chain and takes the same amount of credit to another chain. Whenever users or protocols perform a cross-chain swap, the following set of actions is performed by the smart contract: 1. Accept liquidity from the sender on chain A (e.g. Arbitrum) and check if there is any unbacked amount to be repaid. 2. Pay the outstanding amount and lock the remaining liquidity in the deAaveAdapter. 3. Send a message to the deAaveAdapter on chain B (e.g. Polygon) through deBridge. The message contains a command to take a loan, redeem aToken and transfer liquidity to the receiver. Once the transaction initiated on Chain A is final and irreversible, the deBridge infrastructure will execute the transaction on the destination Chain B in the following sequence: 1. Execution of the passed message in the external call to deAaveAdapter. 2. deAaveAdapter will mint the needed amount of aTokens by calling mintUnbacked function of Portals. 3. deAaveAdapter will redeem received aTokens and transfer the resulting tokens to the receiver by calling withdraw method of AAVE protocol. This design of deAaveAdapter guarantees that the liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain. By this design, liquidity that was lent to deSwap always remains in AAVEs possession as any user/protocol can bridge assets from the chain with an outstanding loan to unlock the corresponding amount of the same asset locked in the deAaveAdapter on another chain. This diagram shows the general flow of a cross-chain interaction when deSwap will be integrated with Portals: !([link]]) Proposed list Credit Line request. The credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains and one of the reasons we haven't deployed on others has been the lack of liquidity for deSwap. Portal is solving this problem and deBridge will prioritize integration to have the list of supported blockchains matching those where Portals are deployed. !([link]]) The maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line. deBridge will pay a 2bps fee on all the liquidity taken from the Portals. Incentives. An incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live. Audits & Security. List of relevant security audits of the network. Security has always been our main priority. deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as. - Halborn. - Zokyo. - Ackee Blockchain. - Neodyme. All security audit reports can be found on our [Github]([link]) deBridge has a long-term partnership with [Halborn]([link]) that audits not only smart contracts but all the modules created for the protocol. We also have an ongoing bug bounty program on Immunefi: [link] We have done extensive research and seen that many bridges are missing various security measures like basic balance sheet validation and nonce sequence validation. These crucial components among others have been implemented in deBridge.

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Telegram: Telegram: Contact @avalancheavax. Technical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium. Support Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support. Summary. This is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge. Motivation. The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process. Driving Factors. Secure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies. Cost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low. Fast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible. Transparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process. Intuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge. Specifications. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team. Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token. Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages. BTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral? BTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain. BTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Avalanches primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages. The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanches liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away. How is the asset currently used? Currently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe. Emission schedule. No emission schedule. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.

Date of deployment: June 21, 2022. The number of transactions: 14,440. The number of holders: 408. How It Works/Technical Specifications. The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called \"Wardens. The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they'll explicitly whitelist each others IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if theres any discrepancy within the critical information. Proposed Technical Parameters. BTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODGUfZoKAO4eEF9SrqSUEUiOpve", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953926, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests listing BTC.b on the Avalanche V3 Market as a collateral asset.

This proposal is created on behalf of Blockchain at Michigan, and in partnership with [Proximity Labs]([link]) We propose to deploy Uniswap v3 on Aurora through an additional grant license and ask the Uniswap community to consider and discuss this proposal. Uniswap will expand access to decentralized and permissionless trading of tokens on Aurora, and aligns with the communitys multichain vision to bring trustless liquidity to all chains and position itself as a de facto DeFi hub in the space. Our proposal will include a $5m amount allocated for financial incentives to Uniswap users on Aurora and a commitment to actively engage with the Uniswap community to further support its growth through grant programs and funding for protocol-related development. Proximity Labs will coordinate with the community and governance participants to distribute these funds and will support future developments and allocations to projects leveraging Uniswap and DeFis ecosystem participants on Aurora. About Aurora. [Aurora]([link])is an EVM-compatible execution environment running on top of [NEAR]([link]), a proof-of-stake layer 1 chain, and takes advantage of its unique features, including sharding and developer gas fee remuneration. Our long-term vision is to provide a user-friendly platform for developers and users to build fast and highly-scalable decentralized applications offering seamless integrations with NEARs native chain as well as different L1s and L2 networks. Transaction costs on Aurora are among the lowest while ensuring a high throughput, scalability, and security. Auroras SputnikVM is a highly optimized EVM that can execute transactions at high speeds while maintaining full compatibility with Ethereums VM. This makes Aurora the perfect platform for applications that require high transaction throughput without incurring high costs. There are a total of 100 active NEAR nodes acting as Aurora Relayers. The transaction finality happens on NEAR when a new block is minted, right after its wrapped in a NEAR transaction and broadcasted to the nodes through one of the relayers. Since the launch of Aurora in May 2021, the average block time has hovered around 1 second, the chain boosts almost instant transaction finality at ~2 secs and a near-zero transaction cost of ~$0.02 on average per tx. Proposal. The Aurora ecosystem has been growing tremendously with very talented builders and founders joining our sides and leveraging Auroras exceptional low fees and fast-finality transactions. New integrations and exciting announcements from major protocols and DeFi players such as Curve, Lido, have made Aurora one of the fastest growing chains out in the space with an ever-growing number of new people joining and interacting with our dApps. Our network consists of a wide array of platforms, from decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and cross-chain bridges. Our flagship protocols include Bastion Protocol, a lending protocol with more than $340M worth of assets deposited; Trisolaris, a decentralized exchange which secures more than $230M in liquidity; and the Rainbow Bridge, [with over $900M in volume]([link]) bridged across NEAR, Aurora, and Ethereum. [Auroras TVL]([link]) sits at $500M, with highs at around $2.64B, demonstrating an overall increasing engagement with our ecosystem and a tremendously growing base of native supporters. There are more than 2.5 mil unique addresses with around 200k new unique addresses per day and we count around 200k transactions daily. Uniswap on Aurora. Aurora has a long history of supporting cross-chain protocol deployment and has been eagerly assisting developers and founders all across various chains and spaces to expand and reach new communities and tap into new ecosystems. Major DeFi protocols such as The Graph, Flux Protocol, and Gnosis have already deployed on Aurora, and other blue chips such as Chainlink and Curve have committed to launching soon. We're aware Uniswap has deployed on major chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Celo, with successful proposals to deploy on Moonbeam and Gnosis Chain. Deploying Uniswap would be the next big step to take to add to the already-growing DeFi hub on Aurora and will undoubtedly position itself as a premier AMM, and a major liquidity hub for Near, offering a seamless trading experience and allowing defi users to take advantage of its concentrated liquidity mechanism. This opportunity will allow Uniswap to gain more exposure within the NEAR community as it positions itself as a primary decentralized exchange hub as we're headed towards a multi-chain economy, and will undoubtedly bring a massive stream of revenue for Liquidity Providers. Incentives. Our proposal comes with financial and non-financial incentives to promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation. We plan on offering $5m from our ecosystem growth fund to the Uniswap community in the form of Liquidity Mining incentives and Developer Grants to support DeFi applications leveraging Uniswap on Aurora and building on top of it: Commit up to $2.5M for a liquidity mining campaign targeting the top liquid pairs to support the overall adoption of Uniswap V3 Allocate a $2.5M fund to support long-term protocol development by funding developers, designers, and community members building on top of Uniswap and driving Auroras growth. Promote and increase Uniswaps visibility within our ecosystem and to new projects, as well as showcase in Auroras marketing campaigns and Near/Aurora hacker houses and hackathons. Rainbow Bridge. Rainbow Bridge is the official decentralized bridge for transferring tokens between Ethereum, NEAR and the Aurora networks. At a high level, Rainbow Bridge works through: 1. LiteNodes (a lightweight node implemented as a smart contract that stores block headers. One deployed on the Ethereum network, which stores NEAR block headers, and one deployed on NEAR which stores Ethereum block headers.) 2. Relayers (scripts running on virtual servers, that periodically read blocks from one blockchain, and communicate them to the LiteNode running on the other.) 3. Connectors (smart contracts responsible for all of the logic associated with the cross-chain management of a given asset type) Proximity Labs and Aurora will build a connector following the community vote to make the bridge compatible with general messaging functionality. This connector will be deployed on both Ethereum and Near and will be responsible for transferring governance votes/messages between both chains. One of the advantages of Rainbow Bridge is its malleability. Any asset or data can be transferred across the Rainbow Bridge if relevant Connectors exist. Bridge Security Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, once the relevant connector will be deployed Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? The bridge is secured by multi-sig. Security is provided by implementing light-clients of both networks on the counterpart network: Ethereum light client on NEAR and NEAR light client on Ethereum. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? Rainbow bridge leverages both chains' security (Ethereum and Near) through the use of Provers on both chains: EthOnNearProver NEAR contract in Rust and NearOnEthProver Ethereum contract in Solidity to verify Ethereum events and Near contract execution results. On Near, trust relies that at no time, 2/3 of the validators stake are honest. Not only the bridge, but also all other applications on NEAR operate under this assumption. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? The rainbow bridge is based on trustless assumptions with no selected middleman to transfer messages or assets between chains. Because of this, anyone can interact with its smart contracts. When players with bad intentions submit bad information, it would be challenged by independent Watchdogs watching the Near blockchain. [Similar attacks on the Rainbow Bridge have been dismissed resulting in the loss of the hackers funds]([link]) What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? The bridge requires having a watchdog service that monitors submitted NEAR headers and challenges any headers with invalid signatures. For added security, independent users can run several watchdog services. In the event one entity runs a majority of the watchdogs, fraudulent messages can be processed Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? The code has been audited by ConsenSys and SigmaPrime. No critical vector attacks were identified. [View Audit Report]([link]) License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Proximity Labs and Aurora to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Aurora, a Layer2 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Aurora by Proximity Labs or Aurora through the \"[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 15]([link]) Proximity Labs or Aurora would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. Timeline. Following the vote on the proposal by the Uniswap community, our team will be ready to start working on the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Aurora. We anticipate a few extra steps that will prelude the full deployment such as: Developing the general message connector on top of Rainbow Bridge Deploying Uniswap V3 smart contracts on Aurora. We expected the full deployment to take anywhere around 4-5 weeks.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODHWHrNEWTpSwHljnWROJRTFae8", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953927, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests deploying Uniswap v3 on Aurora, a blockchain platform operating on NEAR.

Forum Post: [link] Summary. The purpose of this AIP is to list agEUR, Angle Protocols decentralized Euro, on Aave V3 on Optimism and Arbitrum. About Angle. Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has launched agEUR, a Euro stablecoin, which has become the biggest decentralized Euro stablecoin. The TVL in the Angle Protocol is $81m with 47m agEUR in circulation. While for some months, agEUR could only be issued on the Ethereum mainnet, it can now be issued natively on Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum where users can borrow agEUR against different collateral assets (wETH, wBTC, USDC, OP) in an over-collateralized way (\u00e0 la Maker) Borrowing agEUR is not the only way by which agEUR can be minted. The biggest share of agEUR liquidity comes from what we refer to as our Core module. In the Core module, agEUR can be issued at oracle value from USDC, DAI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by relying on the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave) About agEUR. agEUR is a supported asset on the V3 on Polygon, and it has been [voted]([link]) to make it a collateral in isolation mode. So far, there are 900k agEUR circulating on Optimism, and 320k on Arbitrum with almost all the liquidity on DEXes ([Velodrome]([link]) on Optimism and [UniswapV3]([link]) on Arbitrum) making it an easily liquidable asset. Besides these liquidity pools, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. As mentioned above, the stablecoin can be minted/burnt at oracle value on mainnet meaning liquidity for it could be theoretically infinite on any chain beyond these liquidity pools. agEUR smooth cross-chain liquidity is guaranteed by [Angle bridge infrastructure]([link]) which allows to bridge and get the canonical versions of agEUR on different chains. The protocol relies on different bridge providers, with an emphasis on LayerZero. To drastically limit the impact a bridge hack could have on agEUR, the protocol has set up several safety measures (hourly and global limit notably) Overall, agEUR is an over-collateralized stablecoin (current collateral ratio = 203%) with as a backing mostly liquid USD stablecoins (USDC, DAI and FRAX) Links. - Official: [link] - Docs: [link] - Token Contracts: [Mainnet]([link]), [Polygon]([link]), [Optimism]([link]), [Arbitrum]([link]) More generally, all Angle related contract addresses can be found [here]([link]) - Smart contracts/Code: [link] - Analytics: [link] - App: [link] - Governance forum: [link] - Dune Analytics Dashboard: [link] agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon, and it passes all the requirements for feeds on Optimism and Arbitrum. Otherwise, given agEUR consistent and robust peg, Chainlink EUR-USD feed could be used as a starter before they release the agEUR-USD feeds on Optimism and Arbitrum. Security Considerations and Risk Analysis. Angle Protocol had four different audits which can be found [here]([link]) It also has a $500k bug bounty on Immunefi. Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token (which went live in January) Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (Guillaume Nervo, Picodes, Pablo Veyrat), Julien Bouteloup, 0xMaki and SebVentures. agEUR token contracts on the different supported chains are upgradeable and can be upgraded by the multisig described above. Only protocol related contracts have minting rights on this contract, and so theres no multisig or EOA that can directly mint agEUR at the moment. agEUR has been assessed by Curve Team, report is available[here]([link]) Benefits for Aave V3. agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins on Polygon, which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex and more easily arb the stablecoins peg. On Polygon, the fact that its going to become a collateral in isolation mode will allow people to long  and short $ through agEUR (and the agEUR liquidity on DEXes) Onboarding agEUR to Optimism and Arbitrum would provide the same upsides of enabling  shorts and Euro DeFi users to get a yield on their . It would in addition make these opportunities more easily accessible for a range of DeFi users who care about the security provided by layer 2 solutions and about small transaction fees. Theres no Euro stablecoin listed on Optimism, and having agEUR on Optimism would be a first option for European DeFi users to get a yield on their assets without having to care about the USD/EUR change risk. On Arbitrum, with the EURs stablecoin that is already available there, adding agEUR could be a way to facilitate a Euro efficiency mode (beyond the stablecoin efficiency mode) We are working on a Curve pool on Arbitrum to facilitate immediate arbitrages between agEUR and EURs with the efficiency mode. Overall, its very likely that Forex on DeFi won't happen on a single chain, and enabling efficiency mode on different chains is a way to make sure that Aave is well positioned for wherever its going to fully take off. Risk Parameters. With the liquidity on Optimism and Arbitrum in mind, the following parameters are proposed: 1) V3 Emode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor. 2) V3 Emode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor. 3) 0% LTV (meaning agEUR is not a collateral in isolation mode) Protocol Data.

Stader proposes addition of MaticX as collateral to Aave v3 Polygon market. Heres why Matic X will be a strong addition to the Aave v3 Polygon market: About Staderlabs. MaticX is built by Staderlabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~900mn $ in assets with 40k+ users staking with us across Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera. About MaticX. a. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents the users staked assets and accrued rewards. Matic X increases in value relative to Matic as staking rewards accrue. b. MaticX has been audited by top security audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Liquidity for MaticX. a. MaticX has high liquidity on Polygon, with ~3.7 mn$ of liquidity for our Matic <> MaticX pool on Quickswap, within days of LP launch. LPs on more DEXs coming in the next couple of weeks. Benefits to AAVE and Polygon. a. With MaticX, Matic holders can participate in both staking and Defi, unlocking new liquidity from staking for Defi, including Aave. b. Matic holders will be able to promote decentralization of Polygon by staking with multiple high performing validators. c. We expect staking participation of the community to increase as we launch a solution to stake directly on the Polygon mainnet in the coming fortnight. Proposed parameters for MaticX. a. Max LTV has 55% b. Liquidation threshold of 60-65% c. Liquidation penalty of 10-15% Background about Stader. StaderLabs 2 is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera. Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 900 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform. ~$850 M+ Luna staked. $65 M+ HBAR staked. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts. Adding MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon market. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents a users share of the staked Matic assets with Stader. It is a token that increases in price as the staked MATIC accrues staking rewards and these rewards are compounded i.e. MaticX simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC. Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard users funds. MaticX contracts have been audited twice by reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Here are the links to the two Audit Reports: Report 1 & Report 2. You can explore Staders Liquid Staking for Polygon by going over to the Stader Dapp: [link] 1. MaticX is available on Polygonscan at the address: '[hexadecimals]' MaticX Liquidity Pools. The MaticX <> Matic LP is live on Quickswap. LP size ~3.7 Mn USD (within a few days) Expect to significantly increase with dual rewards available for the pool. We are launching staking on the Polygon Mainnet in a few days and this will amplify the MaticX TVL and the LP size manifold (Polygons staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supports staking Matic on Ethereum.) We will also be creating LPs, and incentivising them across other Polygon DEXs. Benefits to Polygon & Aave Community. We believe MaticX will be a great addition to Aave v3 Polygon markets as it will unlock several borrowing use cases including leveraged staking, borrowing other assets with MaticX and potentially several DeGen strategies. Staders selection of validators is transparent (here 2) and centered around generating highest staking returns for delegators and encouraging decentralization of Polygon. High performing validators (100% of last 200 checkpoints, >98% checkpoints in last 90 days) Commissions (<=5%) Preference to lower voting power. We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon) Aave would be one of the first protocols to offer significant lending offerings for MaticX driving a lot of Matic community to Aave. Parameters. Based on the updated WMATIC risk parameters, we propose the following risk parameters for MaticX as MaticX is backed by Matic staked via Staders contract. Max LTV of 55% for MaticX (compared to 65% for WMATIC) Liquidation threshold of 60-65% for MaticX (compared to 70% for WMATIC) Liquidation penalty of 10-15% for MaticX (compared to 10% for WMATIC) We would like to hear feedback and update any specific information/ parameters as suggested by the Polygon and Aave community. Update (July 1, 2022) Adding a small section to update on all the developments from the time of original proposal being published. Traction: More than 13 million Matic by 1.4k+ unique wallets already staked with Stader for MaticX. We launched the ability for Polygon community to stake directly on Polygon in early May without having to bridge to Ethereum enabling cheaper, faster transactions and have seen strong adoption. Liquidity: We have ~10 mn $ in liquidity across DEXs, with a ~5.4 mn $ on Balancer metastable pool (suited for low slippage) On Polygon, currently in Top 2 pools by liquidity size on Balancer Polygon. Chainlink price feed: Our calculated price feed for MaticX from Chainlink is in testing phase and expected to be live in the week starting July 11. Defi and Lending: On lending, we have ~1 mn $ of MaticX already being lent on Polygon Defi (primarily on Meshswap single sided lending) We have also forged strong partnerships across Polygon Defi, including. a) Balancer Labs, Quickswap, Meshswap in DEXs, b) Beefy Finance, Autofarm, Harvest Finance in yield optimizers, Meshswap and. c) Meshswap, Market XYZ in lending. MaticX can be redeemed for the underlying Matic with an unbonding period of ~3 days (80 checkpoints as per Polygon native staking contract) mitigating depeg risks. Look forward to bringing MaticX to the AAVE and Polygon communities. Note: Staders overall now stands around 50 mn $ compared to the 900 mn $ at the time of original proposal due to the unfortunate Terra crash, where a large % of our TVL was. Risk Assessment. [Risk Assessment]([link]) details can be found on the Governance Forum. [image] [image] As with stETH and sAVAX, this proposal recommends listing maticX with borrowing disabled. Comments. Having recently obtained a Chainlink oracle, maticX can be listed on Aave v3 on Polygon. maticX can be added as collateral in Isolation Mode with a Supply Cap in place. A Supply Cap of around $6M is suggested which represents half the market capitalisation of maticX on Polygon and also approximately the value of a trade with 5% price impact via 1inchs aggregator at the time of writing. The Supply Cap should be revised to prevailing liquidity conditions. The initial listing risks parameters for maticX are the same as those proposed for stMATIC with a revised lower supply cap reflecting the lower liquidity profile. Given users may recursively strategy of depositing maticX, borrowing matic, swapping/staking it for maticX and then depositing maticX into Aaves lending pool again, an E-Mode should be created between maticX and MATIC. The Supply Cap is intended to ensure there sufficient maticX liquidity remains across decentralised exchanges, as the strategy has the effect of transferring liquidity from exchange liquidity pools into lending pools. With a calculated oracle, the risk of being liquidated is lower and therefore it is expected the leverage strategies will be more aggressively pursued than the stETH strategy on Aave v2 on Ethereum. The following Isolation and Efficiency Mode parameters would be a good starting place based upon current market conditions: Isolation & Efficiency-Mode Parameters. [image] The Efficiency Mode (eMode) parameters are a balance of used for other applications like sAVAX listing on the Avalanche market and for Stablecoins on Polygon.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODHJXkspbGF1RiFQVyuEgGJ3tp8", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953927, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests adding MaticX as collateral to Aave v3 Polygon market.

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested. Abstract. The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. Its a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection. As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection. Motivation. The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2. Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers. Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets. The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax) With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance. These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period. Specification. The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO. ![Screenshot]]([link]) Voting. FOR Polygon: DO extend the coverage to Aave V2 Polygon.

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave. Motivations. Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Networks metrics are below (source 1): Total trading volume: $160B. Total swaps: 5.91M. Total users: 1.25M. 1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange. The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4. In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors. Benefits to Aave Community. 1INCH is highly liquid. 1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage. 1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. 1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols' revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3. 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? 1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space. 1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling. On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. 1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time. 1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running. 1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency. P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token. 1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions. Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. How is the asset currently used? 1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO. Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3. Emission schedule. The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4. Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached) Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply) Token & protocol permissions and upgradability. The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded  new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance. The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The tokens mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4  there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately. 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig. Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs. 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing. 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals. st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocols governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100% There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively. v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH. The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAOs treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M. The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing. The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value. On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH. There is an extensive list of audits available on Github.

[Link to Working GDoc]([link]) BDIP SUMMARY. The [BanklessDAO Constitution]([link]) doesn't specify a single timezone around which we can all effectively coordinate. This may seem inconsequential most of the time, but twice each year confusion manifests as some regions observe \"Daylight Savings, while others do not. This bDIP will establish Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) as the single reference timezone for meetings and events across BanklessDAO. BDIP BACKGROUND. BanklessDAO is a global community, collaborating across countries and timezones. So far, we haven't identified a single reference timezone for scheduling calls and events, and most of the time its not an issue. Twice each year, however, some regions shift their clocks by an hour, while others do not. Further, this shift isn't coordinated across regions and occurs on a different date depending on where you live. As UTC is the time standard by which most countries regulate clocks and time, it makes sense that bDAO would use this standard as well. UTC is not subject to \"Daylight Savings and most of the DAO already rely on it as a reference to avoid potential confusion resulting from timezone math. BDIP SPECIFICATION. This bDIP introduces new content but is compatible with previous versions and can be considered a minor change. Proposed Form. It is proposed that a new section of the Constitution is created: > DAO Coordination. > BanklessDAO coordinates around Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) Wherever possible, meeting and event times are expressed in this timezone. EXPECTED IMPACT. bDAO will officially have a single, coordinated reference timezone (UTC) ANALYTICS. None. NEXT STEPS. 1. Collect feedback and make any necessary changes to the proposed bDIP. 2. Get Forum consensus (quorum: 51 votes) 3. Snapshot vote. 3. Update the Constitution.

This is the first time an RFP has been put to a DAO-wide vote, so a brief explainer is warranted. --- What is an RFP? RFP stands for Request For Proposals. Its a request by the DAO for interested parties to propose a solution to a problem the DAO has. Anyone can submit a proposal during the submission period, and the RFP manager named in the RFP then decides on the winner during the approval period. What is the ENS Endaoment RFP? This is an RFP to find a fund manager who can manage the bulk of ENSs treasury going forward, with a goal of creating a sustainable fund that can pay for ongoing development needs without depending on revenue from registrations and renewals. Its a crucial part of securing the long-term future of the DAO and of ENS, whatever the broader economic conditions. What am I being asked to vote on? You're voting to approve the issuance of the RFP. If you vote yes, the RFP will be active, and the RFP manager - in this case the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards - will be empowered to choose a winner from any submissions that were made without a further DAO vote. Their choice will be considered a decision by the DAO as a whole. For this specific RFP, there are likely to be subsequent DAO votes required to execute the winning fund managers strategy onchain, but these will come after the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards have decided on a fund manager. --- Overview. The DAO is seeking a fund manager to manage an endowment fund. This fund will be established from some combination of current treasury and ongoing revenue, and will exist to insulate the DAO from economic fluctuations, ensuring it can continue its core operations regardless of the wider economic outlook. Funds will be drawn from the DAOs general funds, currently held in ETH and USDC, as well as from ongoing DAO revenue until the fund reaches its target size. Proposals should outline how much of the DAOs current funds the intend to appropriate, as well as what proportion of ongoing revenue will be required, and for how long. The DAOs accounting basis divides assets into earned and unearned income. Unearned income corresponds to funds paid for registrations and renewals that are future-dated; for example, if a user spends $100 to register a name for 20 years, after a year $5 of that will be counted as earned income and the remainder as unearned income. Unearned income may be incorporated into the fund, but must be risk-neutral with regard to ETH. Earned income should be risk-netural with regard to USDC. The DAOs current balances can be viewed [here]([link]); as of this writing they are: 13,069 ETH (\\~$20M) in earned income $3,817,067 USDC 18,184 ETH (\\~$20M) in unearned income. Scope of Work. 1. Expand the endowment structure specified in the accepted proposal into an executable form. 2. Work with the ENS Meta-Governance stewards to refine the proposal. 3. Implement the proposal onchain. 4. Administer and adjust the endowment as necessary on an ongoing basis. Selection Criteria. The endowment will need to be able to sustain annual withdrawals of at least $4M USDC without a long-term reduction in principal. Proposals should include, at a minimum: 1. Intended high-level fund allocation of the endowment. 2. Initial and target size for the endowment fund, including the proportion of funds sourced from earned and unearned income. 3. How incoming revenues and income will be assigned to the fund. 4. Specific information on how the fund will be managed, and what steps will be taken to minimise custodial risk. 5. A fee schedule for the fund manager. 6. A detailed description of the reporting structures that will be put in place. Priority will be given to proposals that: Minimise custodial risk by using onchain mechanisms that allow administration of the funds without the fund administrator having custody of the funds. Lay out a coherent strategy for how investment returns can be maintained in the short/medium/long term. Minimise capital risks relative to the expected returns. Define clear mechanisms for assessment and adjustment to changing external and internal conditions in order to continue to meet the endowments objectives. Offer a high rate of return proportional to risk. Define a clear reporting structure for frequent and comprehensive reporting of the funds status to the DAO.

Author: @Llamaxyz, Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, 3SE Holdings & @ItsFreeRealEstate. Status: Proposed. Dated: 2022.11.25. --- Simple Summary. As part of the Sunsetting of v1, the v2 -> v3 Migration & the Deprecation of v2 discussions being conducted by the community [here]([link]) and [here]([link]), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets: - Aave v1 \\(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\\) - Aave v2 \\(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\\) Abstract. With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments. Note: The Aave Arc & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the \"Permissioned\" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the \"Permissioned\" code base. Motivation. This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments. Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. Specification. The Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools<!--deployments-->, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses. - Ethereum V1 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V1 Uniswap Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 AMM Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Polygon V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Avalanche V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) References: [Aave v1 Docs]([link]), [Aave v2 Docs]([link]) This represents the first progression toward deprecating the v1 & v2 deployments across all networks.

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus, across five (5) Aave V3 Avalanche assets. There has been recent talk of price manipulation risks in the forums. This proposal only changes parameters for highly liquid assets on Aave V3 AVAX. Abstract. Over the last several months, Gauntlet has been building the simulation infrastructure to support risk management for Aave V3 AVAX. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate the Aave V3 AVAX protocol parameters. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulation analysis currently shows an opportunity to increase capital efficiency on Aave V3 AVAX without adding outsized market risk. The [optimal parameters]([link]) will slightly increase the Value at Risk (in the worst-case scenarios, our simulations estimate that there will be <200k additional insolvencies, which is approximately 0.006%) while meaningfully improving the capital efficiency of the system 2% increase in borrow usage in the system) Although our simulation engine recommends [optimal values]([link]), we recommend implementing a phased approach for this initial set of V3 AVAX recommendations to gather more granular data on user elasticity, which can be used to further fine-tune V3 simulation models. The \"Recommended Value\" below are Gauntlets recommendations for this proposal. Following the implementation of the recommended values, our daily simulations will inform future parameter changes. !([link]]) Additionally, we look forward to launching a Risk Dashboard for Aave V3 AVAX in the near future, but the above details highlight key risk and capital efficiency metrics.

The proposal seeks to onboard the OP token as a collateral asset in Aave V3 on Optimism. The Optimism Foundation could also seed incentives while the initial liquidity of the pool is bootstrapped.

Discord | 45.2k Members -[[link]]([link]) 2. Twitter | 222.8K Followers - [link] 3. Mirror - [link] 4. Twitch - [[link]]([link]) Summary. Initially launched at the end of 2021, Optimism is an EVM equivalent L2 scaling solution. Optimism currently supports 100+ dapps and over $500m in on-chain value. Optimism drastically improves Ethereums scalability while retaining its security through rollup technology - having already saved its users over $1B in gas fees. The OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. OP holders are currently able to vote on various decisions impacting the Collective, including the grants, protocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, and other fundamental changes. The Collective is committed to an [iterative governance system]([link]) that will evolve dynamically over time. Optimism hopes to use the launch of this token to establish a deeper partnership between the Optimism and Aave communities. This proposal would enable OP as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism. Motivation. With the recent release of the OP token, we want to bolster initial growth for Aave V3 on Optimism. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave V3, while being a strong first use case for OP. Aave would be one of the first platforms to support OP as collateral. The OP token is one of the first and leading rollup technology ecosystem tokens, so the Aave community would be supporting the scaling of Ethereum and onboard the cohort of users coming with it. L2s being the home for AAVE v3 could also gain a lot from this synergy. Overall, the use cases will create the opportunity to continue growing liquidity and usage of the Aave v3 pools on Optimism. Specifications. The Optimism Foundation is submitting this ARC. The Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company. It serves as a steward for the healthy, sustainable development of the Optimism ecosystem. As noted above, the OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. At genesis there was an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 OP tokens. The total token supply is set to inflate at a rate of 2% per year, unless changed through governance. ![|624x311]([link]) Since Aave v3 pools were recently deployed on Optimism, the use of OP as a collateral asset is the next logical step. We expect it would be the ideal home for OP pools on Aave, and for it to drive large amounts of volume to these pools. A strong bond between Optimism and Aave is a benefit to both communities. To fully realize this integration, OP would need to be added as collateral. Risk Analysis. Proposed Risk Parameters LTV: 30% Liquidation Threshold: 50% Liquidation Bonus: 12% Reserve Factor: 30% Add Supply Cap: 1M. ![risk_table]([link]]) A non-image version of this table can be found [here]([link]) The above scores are based on our understanding of the Aave risk rubric today (and are subject to change as the Optimism network evolves) Smart Contract Risk The token is a standard ERC20 + ERC20Votes implementation from OpenZeppelin with no custom code. The OP token has had an average of 53,337 daily transactions and a total of ~2.24M transactions to date. There is a large distribution of the token with ~88k holders. Counterparty Risk For the initial airdrop, 5% of the initial OP supply was widely distributed to over 250,000 eligible addresses. 14% of the supply is reserved for future airdrops and 20% is reserved for RGPG where public goods will be retroactively receiving tokens. The OP token and bicameral governance system seeks to facilitate security and decentralization. Market Risk OP is one of the leading L2s and ecosystem projects.

Utility SD (Stader Token) is Stader Labs' protocol token. Users can use SD tokens to participate in governance decisions. With SD staking planned to go live soon, SD token holders will be able to get a share of the protocol revenue. Currently SD tokens are used to incentivize liquidity provisioning, as bribes to veBAL voters and as direct rewards to LPers on the leading DEXes of Polygon. SD distribution ![|387x220](upload://[image]) [Link to litepaper]([link]) Motivation SD currently has $30.1M in trading volume over the last 30 days across centralized exchanges & DEXes. SDs largest liquidity is currently on the ETH network. Given Polygon is an important market for Stader and we use SD tokens for rewarding users, we want to build further liquidity for SD on Balancer, our largest market. Hence Stader proposes to create a 80% SD - 20% MaticX pool on Balancer as the primary pool for SD on Polygon. Given the popularity of MaticX on Balancer Polygon (with MaticX having the second largest liquidity pool ~$20M) we believe this is the ideal pairing for the SD token, with the 80% concentration ensuring lower impermanent loss. MaticX on Balancer Stader has a great partnership with the Balancer DAO, with the MaticX-Matic pool being selected as part of the core set of pools that receive a % of fees as direct bribes from the Balancer DAO to promote healthy liquidity in a pool with a yield bearing token. The MaticX-Matic LP on Balancer is now the largest source of liquidity for MaticX on polygon and Stader has consistently rewarded LPers with high APY driven by steady spends on bribes on the Hidden Hand protocol $500K spent in bribes + direct rewards in the last 6 months) Specifications Governance Stader protocol is governed by the SD token. Holders can actively participate in governance decisions and share feedback on proposals put forward by the protocol. The following decisions will follow the governance mechanism process: Any implication on smart contract parameters for liquid staking Changes to validator selection criteria Changes to fees SD token related Treasury management and SD staking.

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

The Stader Labs team intends to distribute SD incentives to the MaticX Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the 'EmissionManager' contract needs to assign an owner to the 'Emission_Admin' permission allowing SD rewards to be distributed, [1,2] This can only be achieved via the governance process.

Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the distribution of LDO and stMATIC rewards by Lido and the Polygon Foundation respectively across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3,4] Specification. The Stader Labs team will determine the emission rate and duration SD rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAOs ability to adjust the wMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the MaticX / wMATIC loop. The 'Emission_Admin' is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool.

Of BeethovenXs 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal]([link]) Thus emissions towards this gauge both benefit passive veBAL and serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism.

This is a proposal to provide Balancer DAO with an automated way to collect the fees that the protocol has earned from its different layers, convert and bridge them if needed. Therefore, later on, an authorized party can withdraw and distribute them as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. The goal is to ensure that protocol fee collecting process is fully trustless and automated. --- 1. About Mimic. Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative Smart Vaults concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs. Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults. ![[image]]([link]) Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked for many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP and The Graph. 2. Background. Currently Balancer DAO collects protocol fees in three layers: Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum: Mainnet: [hexadecimals] Polygon: [hexadecimals] Arbitrum: [hexadecimals] As documented in [[BIP-19] Incentivize Core Pools & L2 Usage]([link]): - All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum are used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25% - All fees earned by Ethereum core pools are used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25% - All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools are sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split) - Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday. - All fees earned are converted to USDC, except BAL and BAL-like assets which are converted to BAL. - All bribes are paid in USDC. 3. Core Proposal. Our proposal is to provide Balancer DAO with a solution to automate how it collects and distributes its protocol fees. To accomplished this, Mimic will deploy three customized Smart Vaults owned by Balancer DAO, one on each layer. All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when they reach a pre-determined value in USDC. If fees collected are BAL-like assets they will be converted to BAL, otherwise they will be converted to USDC. Both Polygon and Arbitrum Smart Vaults will bridge all USDC and BAL accumulated to the Mainnet Smart Vault every two weeks (one period) Finally, an authorized manager can withdraw those collected tokens from Mainnet Smart Vault to distribute them accordingly as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. Also, it is important to mention that at all times the DAO has full ownership and control of all three Smart Vaults assets. This means that, for example, at any moment it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself. 4. Technical Specification. There will be three Smart Vaults. One deployed in Mainnet, another in Polygon and the last one in Arbitrum. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions, some of those will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that Balancer DAO designates. Those actions are: - Gather and convert to USDC: Gathers assets (expect from BAL and BAL-like assets) from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to USDC (except from USDC itself) - Gather and convert to BAL: Gathers BAL and BAL-like assets from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to BAL (except from BAL itself) - Bridge: Bridges USDC and BAL to Mainnet every two weeks. - Withdraw: Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner. Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code, actions won't be allowed to perform any further logic. In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowments objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. More information here: [[link]]([link]) 5. Operational details. 5.1. Reporting. Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 5.2. Maintenance. Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults on a daily basis, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will make use of its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. In case a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately in order to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee either to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes. 5.3. Fees. Mimic will charge a 2% fee of the assets that are processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD cap for every period of execution (two weeks) 5.4. Termination. As mentioned before Balancer DAO will be in full control of its Smart Vaults and the funds that were deposited into them. This means Balancer DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the Balancer DAO, will be never in control of those funds. 6. Timeline. Once the final details of the Balancer Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility to set up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case. Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by Balancer DAO, setting three Smart Vaults for it shouldn't take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn't take more than two weeks. 7. Contact.

Proposal to add gauge support for the pool WETH/LUSD/LQTY on Ethereum with a 10% emission cap. - WETH 33.34% - LUSD 33.33% - LQTY 33.33% References/Useful links: > New users are limited to 2 links per post. You'll find the link to all relevant resources [here]([link]) Protocol Description. Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD-pegged stablecoin and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110% In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Users borrowing against their ETH use decentralized 3rd party front ends. LUSD has proved its impeccable resilience in time by getting through severe market crashes untroubled. LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system. Liquity is the only lending service available in DeFi that is unstoppable & likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorship. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. No person or group has any control over the protocol  it is \"set in stone in smart contract code and can never be changed. Number 1 on DeFi Safety. Liquity is the DeFi product with the highest process quality in the space, according to DeFi Safety. Motivation. To summarize, LUSD is the Liquity protocol stablecoin. It uses ETH only as collateral. And LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity, capturing the fee revenue. Furthermore, LQTY stakers earn ETH and LUSD as rewards. And LUSD Stability pool depositors that earn LQTY and ETH. So there is already an established demand for the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool. And even during the bear current market, the demand for Liquity has not diminished. On the contrary, since the mid-June market crash: $LUSD market cap went up from $150M to $185M (23%+ increase) Troves went up from 473 to 852 (80%+ increase) The number of $LQTY and $LUSD holders is also steadily growing in time Liquity is now no. 14 in TVL for DeFi protocols on Ethereum. There are two main reasons behind the growing demand. The first one is the recent events with collapsing centralized lending entities that have lost users' funds and trust. An increasing number of them now choose Liquity, which offers no counterparty risk. The recently introduced Chicken Bonds are the second main reason for the increased interest in Liquity. LUSD Chicken Bonds offer an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders while helping to reduce the stablecoin premium and improve its liquidity. It has attracted 50m+ TVL in its first 50 days. In conclusion, the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool should attract significant interest in the Balancer community. Besides, the recent release of LUSD Chicken Bonds further increased the demand for such a pool. ![[image]]([link]) Specifications. 1. Governance: Liquity has no governance. It is built to maximize trustlessness and decentralization. 2. Oracles: Chainlink is Liquitys primary oracle. They are the largest player in the oracle space, have an excellent track record, are sufficiently decentralized, and are constantly improving their systems. Tellor is Liquitys secondary (fallback) oracle. They're fully decentralized  price data is requested, with a \"tip attached  and miners compete to push accurate data and win the tip. Inaccurate data is disputed, and the threat of stake-slashing incentivizes honest price reporting. 3. Audits: Multiple security audits have been conducted by various auditors. All relevant documents are available in the documentation. Additionally, Liquity runs a bug bounty program with Hats Finance. 4. Centralization vectors: There are no centralization vectors. Liquity is built to have maximized resilience. 5. Market History: Over the last months, we have observed a premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. It was further aggravated by recent events leading more and more users to worry about the censorability of centralized stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) and decentralized stablecoins primarily backed by centralized ones (like DAI or FRAX) The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Thus, we have seen LUSD trading at a premium and slightly above the peg, partially caused by the increased demand for LUSD. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are already helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows. You can check here the historical data of LUSD and LQTY. 6. Value: There is a proven in-time demand for WETH/LUSD/LQTY and the pool will be stable and beneficial for the Balancer community.

Author: @Fig Lead Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, with additional support from @AndrewA, a Protocol Specialist at Coinbase. Created: 10/27/2022. --- This Snapshot vote is a temp check to add support for Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to Aave v3 on Ethereum mainnet, once live. v3 offers unique features such as isolation mode, capped supply & borrowing, and e-mode which affords the community more optionality. If passed, and once v3 is live on Ethereum, this will trigger a formal risk review by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs. Parameters will be set leading up to an AIP based on the findings of the risk managers. --- Summary. This is a proposal to add Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to the Aave protocol on Ethereum mainnet. cbETH is an ERC-20 compliant token on Ethereum that represents underlying staked ETH on the Coinbase platform. Motivation. cbETH is a liquid staking token for ETH created by Coinbase with a goal of facilitating a more competitive liquid-staked ETH landscape. There is a meaningful amount of demand for borrowing against liquid-staked ETH. Liquid-staked assets (such as cbETH) make for efficient collateral with underlying margins typically improving over time. Specifications. 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? @Fig is a Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, a leading delegate on Maker, Aave, Optimism, and Hop. Additional support provided by @AndrewA, who is employed by Coinbase. Andrew and Fig also help review grants as part of the Aave Grants DAO. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. Coinbase is supporting liquid staking for its ETH stakers with Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH), where the staked asset is Ether (ETH), and the staking provider and token issuer is Coinbase. With cbETH, Coinbase aims to contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem by supporting high-utility wrapped tokens and open sourcing smart contracts. cbETH follows the cToken model, which allows it to be ERC-20 compliant and easier to integrate with DeFi more broadly. cbETH can be unwrapped for staked ETH plus accrued rewards net of Coinbase staking fees and any network-imposed penalties. Rewards and penalties affecting Coinbase staked ETH change the conversion rate between cbETH and underlying staked ETH. 3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? With maturing volumes, integration of cbETH would allow those that have staked their ETH with Coinbase to borrow against their locked positions while continuing to earn rewards on the underlying staked ETH. The introduction of cbETH into the Aave ecosystem could bring a new wave of retail users who learn about Aave through Coinbase and holding the cbETH token. Many of these new customers may become regular users of the Aave protocol. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, is it live? Products, are they live? How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Coinbase, Inc. (Parent company NASDAQ: COIN) is a prominent cryptocurrency trading platform in the United States. As of 6/30/2022, the company and its global affiliates had 103M+ verified users, $96B assets on platform, and offered services in 100+ countries [source 1] Coinbase is allowing customers who stake ETH to wrap it for an ERC20 utility token called Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (\"cbETH), which is a liquid representation of their staked-ETH. Coinbases mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. In pursuit of this mission, Coinbase builds products to improve access to economic freedom, cbETH being one of these projects. With ETH staked on Ethereum being illiquid and unstaking not being available until post-Shanghai, liquid staking solutions have been a natural development. 5. How is the asset currently used? cbETH allows users who have staked with Coinbase to sell or transfer the ownership of their staked ETH. cbETH is currently traded on Uniswap, Curve, and the Coinbase trading platform. 6. Emission schedule. There is no emissions schedule. Customers who have staked ETH with Coinbase can wrap their staked ETH to obtain the cbETH token. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? Key roles of the contract: 1. oracle - updates the conversion rate for the token. Coinbase controls the oracles address and updates the exchangeRate' every 24 hours at 4pm UTC. This update cadence may be changed in the future. 2. master Minter - can assign minters and their limits. 3. minter - can mint and burn tokens. 4. pauser - can pause all transfers, mints, and burns for the contract. 5. blacklister - can blacklist an address from transferring, minting, and burning. 6. owner - can assign all roles except the admins. 7. admin - can upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself. All privileged keys are controlled by Coinbase using best practices.

This proposal aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem to Celo, managed by Symmetric,and make Symmetric the official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo. Background: Symmetric is a fork of Balancer that currently runs on the Celo and Gnosis Network, and will soft launch on Kava imminently. The project launched in 2021 and has since deployed a V1 and V2 fork of Balancer on both networks in addition to graduating from Celo Camp. Symmetric has close ties to the Celo community and looks to play a large part in Celos mission-based activity moving forward. Symmetric approached BalancerDAO before launching V2, which did not result in an agreement. Symmetric has since shipped and operated their V2 on Gnosis and Celo in July, while BalancerDAO introduced the veBAL tokenomics, launched on Optimism in collaboration with Beethoven, and the bLabs team added a deployment to Gnosis to their roadmap. Based on these changes, we think its the right moment to re-engage and find a mutually beneficial outcome. Motivation. The Celo Ecosystem, despite relatively low usage, is seeing an increase in interest as the ReFi space native to the chain is growing fast, with projects such as Toucan protocol moving onto Celo recently. Another example is Uniswap moving to Celo with a $10M incentive package from the Celo Foundations DeFi for the People initiative focusing on Green Assets. Another significant point is that PrimeDAO is launching a ReFi Launchpad program on Celo in Q4 with $1M in funds available for project launches and liquidity rewards (bribes) We believe we have the right knowledge, skillset, and network to successfully expand the Balancer protocol onto the Celo network and become one of the top three DEXs on Celo by the end of 2023.

Commonwealth Roadmap. Commonwealth is a Web3 platform working to empower Web3 projects. We're continuously building key features and workflows based partner feedback to improve DAO engagement, empower DAO growth and increase DAO success. Upcoming Commonwealth Product Initiatives. - Notifications. - We are building out more robust in-app, email, and push notifications. EPNS has already begun deploying governance notifications for Commonwealth activity. - Moderation. - We are enabling more complex community moderation functionality. This includes time-bans, rule logic for community roles, and spam prevention methods. - Common API. - Our soon to be launched API enables other tools and projects to tap into the social data from the Commonwealth platform. - Common App Store. - Roll out an app store offering full composability of DAO tools within a single interface. This will enable DAOs to process payroll, manage their treasury, create POAPs, etc. without needing to flip applications. If you have a key feature you'd like to see on the Aave Forum, we'd love to chat and build out the functionality to empower Aave. Further Resources.

This exclusive partnership would include ERC-20s, NFTs, and new LBP use cases. Balancer to support the Fjord team with a grant of $500k USD (paid in BAL) and a new rev share to be implemented at the conclusion of the current agreement that will maintain long term alignment. Co-authors: Fjord Team (Ri, PK, Evan, Odin, Kryptachio, Truss) Fjord (Copper) Progress to Date: Fjord has supported nearly $1.5b in LBP volume across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Avalanche since September of 2021 (and hopefully on BNB very soon) Fjord has supported 100+ LBPs across large well capitalized projects to small community projects. Projects supported include DAOs, guilds, gaming, defi projects, and more. Since Fjord began collecting revenue at the end of December 2021, nearly $1.6m in cash value has been distributed to the BalancerDAO wallet and under the current agreement Fjord provides 30% of Fjord revenue to the Balancer DAO. Fjord has strongly pushed for projects to keep liquidity on Balancer post LBP with some success, leading to further revenue and relationship opportunities. Fjord launched the first of its kind, LBPs for NFTs. While still in early stages, the team has high hopes to increase the Fjord user base and attractiveness of the platform by growing the NFT side of the house and to bring NFTs into the Balancer ecosystem. Fjord has seen a significant draw down of LBPs given the challenging market and while building the treasury to survive such down turns, has been required to engage in a large rebrand and faces significant legal and operational hurdles which have impacted runway. Fjord has significantly reduced monthly wages to extend our runway, but this path is not sustainable for the long term. From its current treasury, Fjord faces significant incorporation costs, blockchain analytics AML costs, and ongoing legal costs. Purpose / Motivation: The Fjord team highly values our relationship with Balancer (and the community) and would like to continue in furthering the reach of the Balancer Protocol. This has been a great relationship for both parties and we hope to build new use cases as well as strengthen the ones we have already proven viable. To further diversify our portfolio, Fjord has moved into NFTs and is preparing to launch additional use cases for LBPs. We view NFTs as a strong pipeline for new users to flow into web3, and we want to position ourselves to capture significant market share, much in the way LBPs did for ERC-20s. As we approach the conclusion of the current revenue share agreement between Fjord and Balancer, the Fjord team would like to further strengthen our relationship by entering into an exclusive partnership with Balancer and Fjord. Our team will continue to build upon LBPs for ERC-20s, NFTs, and develop new use cases which will broaden the reach of Balancer. Specification: As the Fjord team continues to build through this bear market, we would request the following grant to help fund our team to include the increasing legal and operational costs we face given the current environment. Fjord requests a grant of $500k USD (to be paid fully in BAL) over the course of six months to support ERC-20 and NFT LBPs development from Q4 2022 through Q1 2023. Key Milestones and Fjord Focus: Refine NFT LBP drops on Balancer. Develope KYC type integration or other whitelisting solutions for LBP participation (adding optionality for teams) Release MVP of new LBP use case(s) Create a Fjord blog to increase user retention (among other features planned to increase retention and community growth) Enable one-click movement of liquidity from Fjord to Balancer Balancer Feature Support: Link to Fjord as the LBP partner for ERC-20s / NFT LBPs from Balancers UI. Collaborate closely on developing NFT solutions and extending LBP use cases and functionality. Enable 0 collateral LBPs. Conduct marketing support to promote our exclusive partnership, the release of new use cases, and increasing general awareness of Fjord Foundry and Fjord NFTs Grant Funding: 80% of funding to be paid in Bal on a monthly basis. 20% of funding to be paid in veBAL to be locked for 1 year from the date of exclusivity Rev Share: At the expiration of the current rev share (Feb 13, 2023), 30% rev share will remain in place until $500k in rev share to the DAO is met. From the date $500k is returned, the rev share will remain at 30% for six months. At the end of the six months, the rev share will be negotiated on an annual basis to maintain long term alignment between Balancer and Fjord. We think this rev share provides long term alignment, for if we have returned $500k this would mean ~$80mm would have been raised by LBPs (assuming 2% fee), and for $80mm to be raised this likely means we are no longer in a bear market (this could easily be 2 years from now) The additional six months at 30% from this point provides Balancer with the upside over this same likely bull market time period. Grant allocation breakdown: ![[image]]([link]) Legal: In-house work for the next 1-2 months is expected to be more intensive, ~ 15 hours / month. Fjord has a planned execution framework with Cayman Council as well as advice from US counsel, but requires more nuanced crypto specific support Once the legal foundation is up and running, the team expects legal needs to sustain at 1 to 1.5 hours per week. This would include liaison support with outside counsel and feedback on legal implications of product decisions Entity structuring costs to build for resiliency Marketing: Video production of an educational series of videos for B2B clients and participants in LBPs, Fair NFT drops and the new use cases we are exploring Social media growth and investing in various forms of content Hosting of and attendance of prominent web3 events to network PR opportunities Search Engine Optimisation.

This Snapshot vote establishes community consensus on whether: 1. New assets are not required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, or. 2. New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% Motivation. Since Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, \"how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the assets initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?\" Gauntlets framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here]([link]) This will work in conjunction with [Aaves existing asset listing framework]([link]) Listing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in. Notably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. Historically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward. Specification. Community input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs: 1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows) However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link. 2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction. Option 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset. Should the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters. Next Steps This Snapshot vote has the below options: 1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% 2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below. Quick Links.

It has been well documented by Xeonus and others that the DAO will run out of stablecoins sometime in Q3/Q4 2023 based on current numbers. While progress has been made to increase revenue it would still be prudent to extend the DAOs runway sooner than later. An opportunity has emerged to cleanly convert BAL to USDC using Aaves [one way bonding curve]([link]) contract. This takes BAL and gives out USDC at the chainlink oracle price of BAL/USD + 50bps. There is ~91.6k BAL left to be filled out of the total 100k BAL. The DAO would gain ~$571k USDC if this swap was made today. You can confirm this number by calling the 7.

However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum. Uniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains. Presently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals. The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair. Problem: Arbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2): Uniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract. To verify, see: owner address [link] set at [link] This address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control. The governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: [link] Therefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state. Solution: To fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following: 1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass) 2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, [hexadecimals] Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done. 3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelocks address alias, [hexadecimals] - This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: [hexadecimals] + [hexadecimals] 1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at [link] 4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional. Conclusion. Uniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODrheHUIRgVuesxRf73Mzj4NL0p", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953963, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, has contracts on multiple chains including Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nIntroduction Balancers access control system is based on permissions, which can be granted and revoked. These are controlled by the 'Authorizer' contract, which was deployed along with the 'Vault' in April 2021. This proposal aims to replace it with the 'TimelockAuthorizer', which provides more fine-grained control over permissions, as well as new security features. It additionally addresses a bug in the 'AuthorizerAdaptor' contract that was disclosed via the Immunefi bug bounty program. For simplicity, this migration will initially only take place on the main Ethereum network and none of the L2s or sidechains. Specification The 'TimelockAuthorizer' contract (developed by Balancer Labs) is a drop-in replacement of the current 'Authorizer' contract, enabling new use cases and providing security improvements. I encourage everyone to read more about each of these improvements, as they will greatly impact the operation of the Balancer DAO if this proposal where to pass (particularly the 'Delays' section) Granular Permissions As of today, permissions are global: an account with a permission can use it on any contract in the entire network. For singleton contracts (like the 'Vault' or the 'ProtocolFeeWithdrawer') this is not an issue since there is only one of them. However, for contracts with multiple instances (like liquidity pools) this means that an account with e.g. permission to set swap fees can use that permission on _any_ pool of the same type (i.e. that is created in the same factory) 'TimelockAuthorizer' allows granting permissions over a single contract, meaning it will e.g. be possible to allow an account to manage a single pools swap fees while not being able to do the same on any other pool. This has always been supported on the original 'IAuthorizer' interface - the current 'Authorizer' simply did not implement this capability (for simplicity) It will still be possible to grant global permissions by passing the special sentinel address known as 'EVERYWHERE' (equal to '[hexadecimals]') Granters and Revokers The current 'Authorizer' features a single all-powerful role ('[hexadecimals]00'), currently held by the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig ('[hexadecimals]') Accounts with this role can grant and revoke any permission - but they are the only one that can do so. 'TimelockAuthorizer' instead distinguishes between having a permission and being a _granter_ or a _revoker_ for a permission. This will increase the capacity of the the DAO Governance Multisig to delegate subtasks to other accounts. For example, instead of simply granting permission to trigger the Liquidity Mining BAL bridging process to the Balancer Labs Operations Multisig, it could make said multisig a _granter_, increasing flexibility (e.g. letting Balancer Labs develop contracts that trigger this process automatically and grant them permission to operate without having to involve the Governance Multisig) The 'TimelockAuthorizer' also has a _root_ account, initially set to the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig, which always has permission to grant and revoke all permissions, and to create and destroy granters and revokers. These permissions cannot be revoked by anyone (except by transferring _root_ to a different account), meaning it always retains full control over the system and can safely evict any rogue granters or revokers. Delays Arguably the most important feature of the 'TimelockAuthorizer' is the capacity to assign _minimum delays_ to certain actions. If an action has a delay, then accounts with that permission cannot immediately execute said action: they can only _schedule_ an execution at some time in the future (greater than the actions delay) Critically, these scheduled executions can be cancelled, which lets the community detect and stop malicious or erroneous actions after they are committed on-chain but before they are actually executed, greatly decreasing the risk of user error, phishing attacks, etc. This also provides users who are not happy with a future action (e.g. increased fees) with the opportunity to exit the system before those measures take place. It is also possible to assign delays to the granting and revoking of permissions. By e.g. delaying granting and revoking the permission to mint BAL (currently only held by the automated Liquidity Mining system), we end up with a much stronger committment to said system, and greatly reduce the risk of e.g. a malicious actor somehow acquiring minting capabilities. Similar measures can be applied to other powerful permissions, such as relayer privilege, adding gauge factories to the 'GaugeAdder', etc. In general, if a multisig wields a permission (e.g. adding gauges) then its _execution_ should have a delay (to review the multisigs action) Instead, if a contract wields a permission (e.g. the 'GaugeAdder') then its _granting_ should be delayed (to review the code of the contract that will use it) For more information on how delays relate to security, see [my talk at the DeFi Security Summit]([link]) Authorizer Adaptor Entrypoint [ChainSecurity]([link]) submitted a vulnerability disclosure via the [Immunefi bug bounty program]([link]) that relates to the operation of the 'AuthorizerAdaptor' Said issue was promptly mitigated and resolved, but operation of some components of the system (particularly adding reward tokens and killing gauges) has been degraded as a result. The 'TimelockAuthorizer' includes a fix for this in the form of the 'AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint', which provides a secure way to restore regular operation. Migration Procedure To ease the transition to this new system, Balancer Labs has also developed the 'TimelockAuthorizerMigrator' contract, which prepares the 'TimelockAuthorizer' by granting some of the permissions that exist in the current 'Authorizer', as well as setting up some initial delays. In order to complete the migration, the migrator needs permission to call setAuthorizer' in the 'Vault', which can only be granted by the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig. Additionally, the Multisig must also claim the _root_ role in the 'TimelockAuthorizer', completing the _root_ transfer from the migrator to the Multisig. This cannot be done before January 5th, 2023, since the root transfer has a minimum delay of 30 days. Execution Details. From the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig ('[hexadecimals]'): - Call 'grantRole' on the 'Authorizer' ('[hexadecimals]') with: 'role': '[hexadecimals]' 'account': '[hexadecimals]' - Call 'claimRoot' on the 'TimelockAuthorizer' ('[hexadecimals]') The 'role' argument corresponds to [the permission to call setAuthorizer' on the 'Vault']([link]), and 'account' is the ['TimelockAuthorizerMigrator']([link]) The 'TimelockAuthorizer' address can also be found [in its deployment]([link]) Recall that 'claimRoot' cannot be called until January 5th, 2023. Once these two steps are done, any account in the network can call 'finalizeMigration' on the 'TimelockAuthorizerMigrator' ('[hexadecimals]') to complete the process. Initial Configuration No new permissions will be granted. The Migrator contract ensures that all permissions granted during the migration exist in the current 'Authorizer' Some of the current permissions have been left out however, since they no longer apply (e.g. permission to pause the 'Vault', which can no longer be paused as of July 2021) Any permissions granted after the deployment of the 'TimelockAuthorizer' (Nov 30th) are not automatically migrated, and will have to be re-granted after the migration. Initial Delays The following actions have initial delays associated to them. As a rule of thumb, I propose that we assign delays to actions with high impact and that do not require urgent execution. Execution - 'Vault.setAuthorizer', 30 days. All delays must be shorter or equal to this one, as they could be otherwise bypassed by simply changing the Authorizer and removing delays entirely. - 'SmartWalletChecker.allowlistAddress', 7 days. Once veBAL is locked this cannot be undone in any way, so extra care should be taken when adding contracts to the allowlist. - 'VotingEscrowDelegationProxy.setDelegation', 14 days. veBAL boost upgrades are infrequent and should be handled with care, since they can greatly affect the veBAL operation. - 'GaugeAdder.addGaugeFactory', 14 days. Adding new gauge factories is a critical action as it grants them permission to mint BAL. See [my talk at ETHLatam (in Spanish)]([link]) for more details. Granting - 'BalancerTokenAdmin.mint', 30 days. This prevents other accounts from being able to mint BAL. - 'ProtocolFeesCollector.withdrawCollectedFees', 30 days. This prevents bypassing the 'ProtocolFeesWithdrawer' - 'GaugeController.addGauge', 14 days. This prevents bypassing the 'GaugeAadder' - 'BALTokenHolder.withdrawFunds', 7 days. This manages the BAL minted for the veBAL gauge. - Vault relayer permissions, 7 days. Relayers are quite powerful, so creating them should be carefully reviewed. The creation of the full list of permissions and their delays can be inspected in [this script]([link]) Risk The 'TimelockAuthorizer' is a relatively complex contract, which will be used to manage all permissions on the Balancer ecosystem, including the Liquidity Mining program and management of Protocol Fees. As such, care should be taken to review it. The Balancer Labs team has been working on this contract for around 8 months, and we are confident in its correctness. It has been [audited by ABDK]([link]), and we're currently working with Certora to conduct a second review.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOE34Iz1qJ2kyYLOLBlhbAboYppX", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953975, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests replacing the current access control system in Balancer with a new one called 'TimelockAuthorizer'.

However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum. Uniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains. Presently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals. The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair. Problem: Arbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2): Uniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract. To verify, see: owner address [Address [hexadecimals] | Arbiscan]([link]) set at [UniswapV3Factory | Address [hexadecimals] | Arbiscan]([link]) This address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control. The governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: [Address [hexadecimals] | Arbiscan]([link]) Therefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state. Solution: To fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following: 1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass) 2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, [hexadecimals] Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done. 3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelocks address alias, [hexadecimals] <em>This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: [hexadecimals] + [hexadecimals] 1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at [L1 To L2 Messaging | Arbitrum Documentation Center]([link])</em> 4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional. Conclusion. Uniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOE3VlupcPqEvNIQRVgfgcFgXYbt", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953975, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that is deployed on different blockchain networks.

Chaos Labs proposes to expand the scope of its engagement with Aave to include proactive risk analysis and management of the v2 markets while encouraging and supporting a safe migration to the upcoming Ethereum v3 deployment. The current engagement is focused on providing risk analyses and parameter recommendations across only v3 markets ([Discussion link]([link])) With the recent volatility in the markets and attempted exploit through the CRV pool, our resources have shifted to supporting Aave v2 on Ethereum, as well, to ensure protocol stability and security. We wanted to put this a community vote and formalize coverage and expectations around Chaos' work on this instance and support during the launch and transition towards v3 on relevant protocols. Background. Chaos Labs was approved as a risk partner for Aave v3 earlier last month and have begun work to launch the [Community Parameter Recommendations]([link]) in the coming weeks covering all relevant v3 markets across LTV, Liquidation Threshold, Liquidation Bonus, and Supply/Borrow Caps with other metrics coming shortly thereafter. As liquidity in DeFi has dried up and volatility in non-pegged assets has increased, the risk situation for Aave v2 has become a greater concern to the community, with more surface area to be covered. It was not our intention to cover v2 during this engagement, as we were heads down and focused on v3. As the market volatility picked up, Chaos was asked (both publicly and privately) for our analysis of the state of the protocol to support and help minimize the risk of additional bad debt accrued to the protocol. Through the forum discussions around the appropriate risk response to the existing market factors, we aligned with the community that not all markets needed to be frozen, and there was a path forward with mitigated parameters, which we stepped in to propose in order to allow the community to have a voice both in the forums and via governance votes. All have passed with a significant show of support. We are still iterating and publishing the amended parameters for v2 in line with those early proposals and have begun discussions analyzing the most appropriate path to transition usage to v3. Through our first month as a contributor, we have coordinated with other DAO contributors to submit several risk proposals, including: - [v3 Supply Cap Recommendations for Uncapped Assets (Fast-track)]([link]) - [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool (AIP 125)]([link]) - [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LT and LTV (2022.12.01)]([link]) - [V3 Borrow Cap Recommendations (Fast-track) (2022-12-05)]([link]) - [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)]([link]) Additionally, we have published research on a number of topics to help inform community discussion: - [v2 Liquidation Threshold impact analysis]([link]) - [BTC vs. WBTC Oracle Analysis]([link]) - [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool]([link]) Aave v2 is the only instance of the protocol live on Ethereum mainnet today, while the development for v3 to launch is ongoing. Usage capabilities of Aave v2 have been curtailed significantly, first by freezing several assets and subsequently unfreezing a portion of them to allow for supplying of \"risky assets and enabling borrows for well-structured \"pegged assets. The transition to Aave v3 on mainnet will not be entirely seamless and will require the support of all contributors and community members to ensure it goes as smoothly as possible. Proposal. Scope. Based on the work done to date in a short time frame and the amount of work ahead to transition from v2 to v3 on Ethereum, Chaos Labs is proposing to extend the scope of the original engagement to support parameter optimization on v2 as well as conduct relevant risk analyses during the transition planning. Our priority with this added scope would be to methodically update parameters, protect existing user funds, and mitigate new potential risk factors on v2 while ensuring the capital efficiency of v3 is a more attractive option for new users. This includes topics and considerations such as: Methodically amending asset parameters to incentivize new users to open accounts on v3. Initiating coordination with third-party protocols building on top of v2 to assist in transition planning, communications, and timing. Helping analyze incentive (both treasury- and parameter-managed) schemes to incite account transitions. Continued analysis of the impact of market events and risk scenarios for the DAO. This work will be in conjunction with our existing v3 responsibilities and should not materially impact timelines for delivery during the coming months. Duration: We propose this engagement to align with the 6-month anniversary of our original engagement, thus covering the remaining 5-month period. The intent is to bridge the transition from v2 to v3 during this period with a finite end date and not continue on indefinitely. If there is still material TVL on v2 at the end of this period, we will discuss the appropriate next steps and maintenance/monitoring expectations with the community. Compensation: $250k streamed linearly over the 5-month period (equating to $50k per month) - 30% ($75k) payable in AAVE tokens. - 70% ($175k) in stablecoins\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOE3UncHVZPOOPRHfFbjuzN5LECO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953975, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chaos Labs is proposing to expand its partnership with Aave to provide proactive risk analysis and management for the v2 markets, as well as support the safe migration to the upcoming Ethereum v3 deployment.

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Midas), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy) Transfero. Transfero Group is an international financial solutions company based on blockchain technology in the Crypto Valley, Switzerland. Its objective is to connect emerging countries to the global market through a platform of financial solutions based on blockchain infrastructure, providing greater efficiency, flexibility, and access for people and businesses. Transfero also developed BRZ, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by Brazilian real (BRL), to give South Americans a reliable asset to the blockchain industry. The BRZ token is live on Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Stellar. BRZ was featured in a World Economic Forum panel in 2020. BRZ is integrated with fiat on and off-ramp (BityPreco) and crypto-card solutions (Wirex) and can be borrowed and lent on money markets (Midas) Motivation: The role of the 2brl pool is to increase the stability of BRZ (1), the on-chain liquidity of both BRZ and jBRL (2), and connect the Transfero and Jarvis ecosystems (3) Together, these 3 points allow for building a Brazilian DeFi ecosystem. 1. BRZ peg: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC back and forth at the BRLUSD Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the BRZ peg. 2. On-chain liquidity: BRZ: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jBRL or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap BRZ to jBRL and then to USDC to access the latters liquidity or vice versa. jBRL: jBRL main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jBRL minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets); this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jBRL-USDC and jBRL-ETH, but this will be for another proposal) 3. Connect ecosystems: the 2brl pool connects Transfero and its BRZ (essentially a fiat on and off-ramp for Brazilian DeFi users) to the jBRLs ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases. Credit without FX risk: borrow jBRL, swap for BRZ, then redeem BRL. DeFi on-ramp: use BRL to mint BRZ, then access yield or on-chain liquidity. Remittance: connect BRZ fiat on and off-ramp to any other jFIAT or USDC fiat on and off-ramp (we already performed payments between Brazil and Mexico and Brazil and France on the BNB Chain) A few notes: Jarvis LTD has started building a position in BAL and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same position. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools to bribe veBAL voters (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot) Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield. This proposal is the first of many, as Jarvis Network is moving all their liquidity pools from Curve (stable pools) and Uniswap/Sushiswap/Kyber (volatile pools) to Balancer. Specifications: 1. Governance: Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a \u215d multi-sig (only one team member in the signers) Polygon: [hexadecimals] Ethereum: [hexadecimals] Gnosis Chain: [hexadecimals] BSC: [hexadecimals] Avalanche: [hexadecimals] Optimism: [hexadecimals] Transfero: centralised entity. 2. Oracles: jBRL uses BRLUSD Chainlink price feed; BRZ token does not have a price feed. 3. Audits: Jarvis: [link] Transfero: 4. Centralizing vector: jBRL is mainly collateralized by USDC; BRZ is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a centralized entity. 5. Market history: jBRL has been live since February 2022 (on the BNB Chain); it has traded a bit off its peg during the FTX crisis due to a too-high supply of jBRL on a money market vs. a too-low number of jBRL minted through the Liquidity Pool (the number of jBRL that you can sell in the Liquidity Pool = the number of jBRL that people has bought; so people borrow a lot of jBRLs from the Credit Line or which have been minted through the Printer, and sell them all through the Liquidity Pool, it can prevent other jBRL holders from selling jBRLs through the pool, preventing any arbitrages from happening) We have solved the issue by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. At the same time, BRZ had an issue with its peg because its primary off-chain market was on FTX, and the pool used a wrapped BRZ from Solana. Besides last weeks event, both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch (on the BNB) We have learned how to prevent these situations from happening again or fix them quickly. Two other rare cases can prevent users from buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pools (again leading to preventing arbitrages from happening), and we also know how to mitigate them (currently working on it as we speak) 6. Value: The 2brl pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.) It will be our first step toward moving our ecosystem to Balancers.

A proposal to adjust one (1) total risk parameter - Supply Cap - across one (1) Aave V3 Optimism asset. This should reduce risk in the protocol, though it does limit the growth of AAVE deposits on Optimism. Abstract. There is currently not a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aaves v3 deployment on Optimism. We are going to set this quickly and provide a deeper analysis of all of the current supply caps next week. We believe these could be more conservative, but setting a supply cap for AAVE sooner rather than later will reduce the chance of new positions creating a dangerous spike in VaR. Beyond this, the cap greatly reduces the viability of market downturn and price manipulation attacks involving the AAVE token. Motivation. Any market without supply caps could experience an outsize risk by someone opening a very large position quickly. Maintaining supply caps that ensure that one user cannot subject the protocol to outsize risk is a key part of risk management for Aave v3 markets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. This change was driven by analysis focusing on insolvency, as estimated by our simulations. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) The input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Theres limited AAVE liquidity on [Optimism on Uniswap]([link]), with $121k AAVE/ETH being the largest AAVE pool. The current AAVE supply on Optimism Aave v3 is $4.7M, so a liquidator will not be able to arbitrage a large AAVE position solely on Optimism DEXs. However, the liquidation bonus at 10% is high enough that we anticipate liquidators should be willing to hold or bridge AAVE. As the markets on Optimism grow, AAVE will rely more and more on the asset bridge and available cross-chain liquidity. This is why we mentioned that all of these caps could be more conservative, and look forward to sharing more info there next week. If the Aave community wants to take a conservative stance on risk, we should consider lowering these across the board.

Summary: Deploy Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools to BNB Chain in order to facilitate fair token launches. Co-authors: BNB Chain foundation, Fjord Team, and Orb Collective. References/useful links: [Website]([link]) [Documentation]([link]) Protocol Description: BNB Chain comprises BNB Beacon Chain (previously Binance Chain) and BNB Smart Chain (previously Binance Smart Chain) BNB is the largest chain by users and transactions. BNB Smart Chain relies on a system of 23 active validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that supports short block time and lowers fees. Introduction: Market manipulation in token launch events is a well-known problem. Market manipulators and other players with malicious intentions or perverse incentives target launch events that occur in BNB Chain to profit through dishonest practices, causing great damage to the young projects that launch their token, retail users and consequently, to the chain. Manipulation usually occurs with small projects that are launching their token with low liquidity of the collateral coin. In these cases, the project token has a very low starting price, which makes it fairly easy to manipulate the price and generate a price spike by buying in bulk. Once that spike is generated, manipulators only have to unload their tokens on the rest of the market participants. The mechanisms to limit manipulation on token launches and during the first hours of existence of novel projects are limited as growing demand will easily drive the price up. Nevertheless, by launching a token on a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool, the project token would support a tremendous selling pressure by setting up an extremely high starting price. The price is programmed to go lower and lower until demand manages to counterbalance the selling price. Therefore, incentives that a possible price spike could have on the price are limited and almost detached. Balancers LBPs have proven effective in limiting price spikes during token launches and therefore the incentives to manipulate the market. We want to allow projects that launch a new token on BNB Chain to be able to protect themselves from this manipulation thanks to the technology developed by Balancer in the form of LBPs. Purpose/Motivation: The only option that small projects have to protect their token launch from manipulation is deploying huge amounts of liquidity in form of the collateral token, making manipulation much more costly. Small projects do not have the ability to bootstrap a large amount of liquidity at the time of launching their token, effectively hindering the success rate of small projects by being more vulnerable to manipulation. BNB empowers both small and big developers to build in our chain, but the former does not currently have a specific tool to protect their launches in the same way as the latter. For this reason, we consider it crucial to allow all projects that decide to launch a token on our chain to use Balancers LBPs. Balancer would benefit from an increase in its fees by being deployed in the chain that today has more activity, while BNB would increase the degree of protection for both developers and users during launch events. We believe that for example, it would be very attractive for GameFi, one of the strongest BNB verticals, so that the demand for the tokens in their launch becomes as organic as possible. Allowing a natural price discovery mechanism in which the price is determined by player demand and not by perverse incentives. The implementation of the LBPs by Balancer in BNB Chain also represents the first collaboration between both entities and  if this proposal is approved by the governance  it could be used as a precedent to consider further Balancer applications. The engagement generated by this proposal, as well as the learnings of a hypothetical Balancer deployment for launching LBPs in BNB Chain could be leveraged by both parties for future collaborations in a mutually beneficial way. Specification: This proposal is to approve the deployment of LBPs in BNB Chain by Balancer. If the proposal goes ahead, both teams will start working as soon as possible to establish the necessary technical framework to make it possible for projects that launch a new token to use the Balancer service. Requirements from Fjord Foundry & Fjord NFTs (Formerly Copper Launch): The Fjord Team is prepared to lead LBPs on BNB for token launches and NFT collection drops. Launching projects in the past have been interested in direct LBPs on BNB and we would be excited to be part of this effort. Fjord would need the Balancer Protocol smart contracts deployed on BNB to include Vault, BNB subgraph indexing, and LBP 0 decimal factory.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOE40sAqeyMBniW7GwSvo8jYWMaO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953976, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests deploying Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to the BNB Chain to ensure fair token launches.

We are now ready to begin rolling out the upgrade. In this post I'll briefly describe the DPR, run through the rollout plan, and finally link to a POOL Snapshot vote that authorizes the Executive Team to upgrade V4. The DPR is the final step in PT Incs plan to further decentralize V4. You can read more about the whole process in the [PT Inc. Protocol Team Q4 2022 TBR]([link]) Draw Percentage Rate tldr; the DPR allows us to have large, infrequent prizes Currently, prizes are awarded in daily draws. The Finance Team sets the total daily prize amount and how that amount is split across prize \"tiers\" Each tier has a certain number of prizes, so the Finance Team may decide to allocate 10% to tier 0 (the grand prize) and 90% to tier 7 (where there are 128 prizes) The problem with the current model is that we can't allocate a portion of the yield to more irregular prizes; to prizes that may occur once per week, for example. This limits our ability to have \"headline prizes\"; giant prizes. The upgrade improves on this by introducing the draw percentage rate. The DPR adjust the odds of prizes occurring to ensure that, on average, the prizes will match the expected returns. This is best illustrated with an example! Lets say: - Prizes area allocated in daily draws. - The TVL for a prize pool is $1m. - The total prize amount is $10,000. - The DPR is 0.000274. The Draw Percentage Rate tunes the prize odds so that the daily prizes approximately equal the expected returns. ' Expected Returns = DPR TVL. Expected Returns = 0.000274 $1m = $274. ' The total prize amount is $10,000 so we can calculate the odds adjustment like so: ' Odds adjustment = Expected Returns / Total prize amount. Odds adjustment = $274 / $10,000. Odds adjustment = 0.0274. ' This means that the odds of all prizes will be scaled by 0.0274. The daily grand prize will only occur every (1/0.0274) or 36.5 days. The added benefit of the DPR is that prizes will adjust based on the TVL. As long as the underlying yield APR remains the same, the prize distribution needs to be adjusted far less frequently. Rollout Plan. We're going to roll out the upgrade progressively, in order to minimize risk and ensure there is minimal disruption to prize claiming. The upgrade may cause delays in the ability to claim, but it will not stop prize distribution. Note that these dates are tentative! If there are roadblocks we will progress more slowly, and if the rollout progresses smoothly we can move faster. | Date | Description | | --- | --- | | January 3rd | Finance Team finalizes new prize distribution utilizing the DPR | | January 3rd | Avalanche V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 5th | Ethereum V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 9th | Polygon V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | | January 11th | Optimism V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR | Vote.

Abstract. The Aave v2 Collector Contract has accumulated a holding in several assets over time. Assets from the v1, v2, RWA, ARC and AMM depoloyments all accumulate in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract. This proposal is the first of several intended to consolidate the various Collector Contracts and Treasury holdings. This proposal seeks to consolidate 17 assets in the v2 Ethereum Collector Contract to USDC and redeem ammTokens for the underlying assets. Motivation. The DAO is currently accunulating over 60 assets in the v2 Collector Contract from various Aave deployments. Many of these holdings are of small economic value, are undercollateralized assets, or exhibit volatile pricing behaviour. Upon consolidating the DAOs assets into USDC, which most of the DAOs costs are denominated in, Llama intends to present the community with suggested recommendations for deploying a portion of the larger holdings. The AMM Liquidity Pool, v2, attracts very little capital and usage relative to other deployments. A number of the assets are frozen and, with v3 being deployed on Ethereum soon, it makes sense for the DAO to relocate this capital away from from the v2 AMM deployment. This proposal enables the following ammTokens, aAmmDAI, aAmmUSDC, aAmmUSDT, aAmmWBTC, and aAmmWETH to be redeemed periodically by calling a contract. Any actor will be able to interact with the contract via Etherscan. Llama, or anyone else, can redeem these ammTokens periodically with the underlying asset to be held within the v2 Collector Contract. Specification. Thie following assets held within the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract are to be converted to USDC via swap contract. !([link]]) Users will be able to deposit USDC and receive the tokens mentioned in the table above, plus a small premium. The premium is expected to reimburse the cost incurred from swapping the applicable token to USDC along with associated gas costs. The methodology enables actors to support Aave in swapping one asset for another by creating an arbitrage opportunity in a decentralized manner. The following assets are to be redeemed from the AMM deployment. !([link]]) Implementation. The below outlines at a high level the flow of events this proposal will acheive: 1) Redeem aTokens and ammTokens for underlying asset. 2) Deploy a Swap Contract whereby actors can deposit USDC and receive a selected token stated in the above table at the Chainlink Oracle price + premium. 3) v2 Collector Contract receives USDC.

In response to recent events at Tribe DAO, this proposal presents the Balancer community the opportunity to redeem its TRIBE holding for a combination of stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI after conditions of the pending veBAL transaction vote are met, [5] Upon receipt the LQTY, FOX and DAI is to be converted to USDC. Abstract. With Fei Lab announcing a 5th October voting date for the Tribe DAO veBAL holding sale and a positive voting outcome expected, Llama proposes Balancer DAO redeems the TRIBE holding for an estimated $640.5K after 1M DAI from the FEI Peg Stability Module (PSM) has been made available to the TRIBE Redeemer contract. Balancer DAO holds 2.8M units of TRIBE in the Treasury which can be redeemed for 308.04 stETH, 6,729.56 LQTY, 993,593.68 FOX and 189,047.55 DAI worth an estimated $634,366.29 at spot prices, [1, 2] After a successful vote and token swap between Tribe DAO and Aave Companies, Balancer DAOs TRIBE holding will receive an additional 6,113 units of DAI when redeemed. This is based upon the 21.80 units of DAI per 10,000 units of TRIBE exchange rate mentioned by Fei Labs on Tribe DAOs governance forum, [1] As Balancers Snapshot will start after Tribe DAO Tally vote, Balancer DAO will be positioned to redeem TRIBE soon after the veBAL transaction is complete. Do note, Lama is in direct contact with Fei labs, Tribe DAO and Aave Companies and will be able to provide updates as and when needed. If the vote is to not pass in favour, then no action is to be taken. Motivation. With Tribe DAOs TIP-121 vote passing, the protocol has entered a terminal state as outlined below, [3]: FEI becomes wrapped DAI, redeemable 1:1 and fully backed specifically by DAI TRIBE becomes redeemable for a pro-rata claim on each remaining asset after setting aside DAI backing for FEI. Notably this excludes all TRIBE in the Tibre DAO Treasury. As Balancer DAO has already dissolved its FEI holding, only the remaining TRIBE holding needs to be redeemed for the underlying assets held within the PCV. The redeem contract for TRIBE token holders was deployed on the 25th September 2022. TRIBE can now be redeemed for stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI, [4] When Aave Companies has escrowed their 1M DAI, Tribe DAO will transfer 1M DAI from the FEI PSM to the TRIBE Redeem contract allowing TRIBE holders to access the 1M DAI immediately. Once this has occurred, Llama recommends Balancer DAO redeems the full TRIBE holding. The difference between Balance DAO redeeming now or after the additional 1M DAI deposit into the TRIBE Redeem contract is an estimated 6,104 DAI. Once the LQTY, FOX and DAI assets are received, they are to be transferred to the Liquidity Mining Multisig where they will be converted to USDC then transferred back to the main treasury wallet. The DAI is to be converted to USDC via Maker DAOs USDC PSM and the other assets swapped. Further details can be found on Tribe DAO governance forum. > [link] > [link] Specification.

Status: Snapshot-only HIP. The Hop DAO [Community Governance Process]([link]) currently relies on a combination of Snapshot temperature checks and on-chain voting for multisig execution and/or on-chain voting for decision-making. However, there is a need to update and clarify this process to better reflect the needs of the community and ensure that all decisions are made in a transparent and fair manner, while balancing efficiency and responsiveness in decision-making. To that end, we propose the creation of a modified voting framework that will allow for more flexibility and responsiveness in decision-making. 1) No vote nor HIP needed. The Community Multisig can execute autonomously if small values are involved/transferred (less than $5,000) and does not directly benefit any person/entity outside of the Hop DAO itself. Examples: - Claiming an airdrop (value of airdrop claim is <$5,000 market value) 2) Snapshot-only HIP. A simple snapshot vote (via [snapshot]([link])) will be sufficient for decisions involving larger values (greater than $5,000) from the multisig or for decisions that do not impact the core Hop Protocol. This will allow the community to have a say in decisions that could have a significant impact on the Hop DAO, but will not require the full on-chain voting process which can be time consuming and resource intensive. Examples: - Directing community multisigs veNFT to a new Velodrome pool (market value of veNFT is ~$40,000, calculated as 2M VELO @ $02) - This proposal modifying the Community Governance Process (no changes to core protocol) 3) Fully on-chain HIP. A fully on-chain vote (via [tally.xyz]([link])) is only needed if executable code is attached to the vote or if changes are being made to the core Hop Protocol. These decisions are of the highest importance and will require the full transparency and participation of the community to ensure that they are made in the best interests of the Hop DAO. HIPs which fall into the category of a fully on-chain vote would also still require Snapshot temperature checks as currently outlined in the governance process. Examples: - Funding new multisig for grants program (requires on-chain transfer of $HOP via executable code) - Deploying Hop Bridge to new chain (change to core Hop Protocol) This HIP is the first to be governed by its own proposal and would also fall into category 2 for which only a Snapshot vote is necessary.

Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto. Dated: 2022-12-17 (updated) --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools. Abstract. There is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%]([link]) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45% By changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves. Due to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finances staking contract]([link]) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk. Motivation. Users are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. The three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time. !([link]]) !([link]]) !([link]]) In addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100% The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. !([link]]) Utilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45%  73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18% With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finances auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further. The improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from 96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units. With respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230% The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6% This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency. Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3. |Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)| | --- | --- | --- | |Uoptimal|45|80| |Base|0|3| |Slope1|7|14| |Slope2|300|150| |Reserve Factor|20|20| The below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3. |Polygon Parameter| Units | | --- | --- | | Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)| | Borrow Cap | 256,140 | Borrow Cap is calculated: (Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap.

While it is the duty of the node operators to anticipate the changes in the economics of their business in advance, the issue at hand here is the need to urgently re-home a large number of validators without acting against the node operators' will. In other words, we cannot force them to take on the keys that will lose them more money than before, but still need to allocate almost 10,000 keys to someone. This calls for a structural change in our product on Gnosis Chain. We believe such structural change would be to increase the staking fee to 15% of the rewards. The benefit of increasing the fee to 15% is that there is less contribution to further centralization because more operators can handle the financial requirements of supporting GC at this price point. The drawback, of course, is the higher fee that will be applied to stakers as a result of this change. To put this into numbers, stakers will lose ca 0.6 percentage points of consensus-level rewards (annualised), earning 10.04% APR after the change (vs 10.66% APR now) We believe this is a tolerable reduction given the importance of keeping Gnosis Chain decentralized and the validator performance as solid as possible.

A proposal to adjust eight (8) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for four (4) assets on Aave V2 Ethereum. Abstract. Following recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121]([link]), [AIP-124]([link]), and [AIP-125]([link])) After mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of long-tail assets on Ethereum v2 (ENS, MKR, SNX, and CRV) This proposal is the second in a [series of proposals]([link]) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on v2 assets. Motivation. Capital efficiency reductions on v2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors, in part by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies. As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the [Risk-Off Framework]([link]) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat) In the graphs below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users for community discussion.

While we don't always see eye to eye with others, rational discourse is valuable in decentralized organizations. Balancer is stronger when differing viewpoints can be presented in a civil, constructive manner, and individuals have a voice in governance. Over the last few days, a constructive dialogue has been opened between Aura, Balancer, and the veBAL whale, Humpy. We have come to the following agreement, which we'd like to formalize on chain as a BIP. 1. Aura will withdraw support for [[link]]([link]) and recommends that proposal not be moved to Snapshot. 2. All parties mutually recommend that the following proposals not be moved to Snapshot: A. [[link]]([link]) B. [[link]]([link]) C. [[link]]([link]) 3. All parties have agreed that no hard caps shall be implemented for the tetuBAL gauge. Instead, Humpy shall move his votes to 17.5% on the tetuBAL gauge, and avoid putting more than 17.5% on any single gauge in the future. 4. Humpy has committed to using his remaining votes on voting incentives where the \"bribe $ per veBAL is greater than the \"$ value of emissions per veBAL. A. Aura has agreed to facilitate the creation of a script for Humpy to help him allocate his votes optimally. 5. Humpy has expressed support in voting for pools that are beneficial to the long-term growth of Balancer in line with other major stakeholders. 6. All parties have agreed to a gentlemans agreement to not meddle in each others affairs. 7. To ensure that 51% attack is off the table, Humpy has agreed not to increase his position, and to unwind ~750k veBAL starting immediately, and allow Balancer governance to blacklist his addresses if they extend unlock time. Likewise, Balancer shareholders have agreed to unwind ~750k veBAL in the same time period as well. A. Humpy addresses: 1. [hexadecimals] 2. [hexadecimals] 3. [hexadecimals] B.

Finally, Humpy has agreed to withdraw his delegation from Andrea81, who will no longer be representing Humpy going forward. We recommend that Andrea81 be withdrawn as the Tetu delegate as well. For this BIP, in the spirit in which it was made, we request that discussion be as friendly as possible.

We propose allocating 19,621 PSP rewards to users staking in sPSP10 by the middle of Epoch 24 (block 15712957) to rectify the volume it accrued while the staking system was not automatically reporting it. To compensate the Market Maker, we propose sending 19,621 PSP rewards to the Market Maker vesting contract. Pool4. Meanwhile, to deal with the external circumstances of Wintermute temporarily pausing DeFi operations, we propose: 1) Final distribution of 170,000 PSP to the users staking in sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 stakers by the middle of epoch24 (block 15712957) to cover for their Accrued Yield losses on sPSP4 while we propose moving into the new transition system for PSP 2.0. 2) Pausing of Pool4 deposits. 3) Reduction of cooldown to 2 days to allow an easier transition into another pool. Both pool4 and pool10 rewards will be distributed via a distribution contract, and users will need to claim from a native UI to be built after the vote passes. Context. The current PSP staking system consists of a stake-to-signal mechanism in which stakers opt into any of the different ParaSwapPools representing Private Market Makers. Recently, ParaSwapPool10s wallet change led to an epoch period (Epoch 24) in which, despite the Private Market Maker still accruing volume, no yield was reported to stakers. This led to ParaSwapPool10 stakers not receiving the yield they should have during Epoch 24. This proposal aims to solve this situation by distributing the missed rewards to wallets that were staking by the middle of Epoch 24, hence did not have time to change to another pool and get that pools rewards. Additionally, the proposal will send the corresponding Market Maker rewards to the Market Makers vesting contract. Additionally, Wintermute, the Private Market Maker behind Pool4, has ceased operations following a hack. This circumstance has been outside the control of both stakers and ParaSwap. For that reason, we propose to assist stakers of this pool in transitioning easier to a new Market Maker and receiving a legacy amount of emissions as we begin transitioning to the new system. To make a fair estimate of the legacy amount (170,000 PSP) we took into account the average last 6 epoch rewards allocated to Pool4. Goals and Means. - To compensate previously missed rewards for Pool10 stakers. - Provide 19,621 PSP to Pool10 (sPSP10) mid of epoch 24 stakers and 19,621 PSP for Market Maker, totaling 39,242 PSP. - Provide 170,000 PSP to sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 mid of epoch 24 stakers as an early migration into the PSP2.0 transition system and compensate for Accrued Yield losses. - Pause deposits into sPSP4. - Reduce cooldown to 2 days on sPSP4. Forward Thinking Considerations. Assuming the proposal for PSP 2.0 passes, all future pools will receive similar emissions for users, as they will no longer be tied to Market Maker performance. This proposal will not interfere with the current PSP 2.0 discussion, as this one only deals with epoch 24. Eligible addresses.

Overview. This proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP) The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don't fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model. The current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal]([link]) passed on Sept 26, 2022. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 6 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL and bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-76]([link]), changes to this are outlined below. Request is 84,791 BAL total to top up the treasury (currently 16,369 BAL uncommitted) for 70,000 BAL to future grantees, 11,850 BAL for committee/support, 19,310 BAL Fjord Top up (Details below) As always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community how to better develop the Balancer grants program. Previous Performance. Currently managing 18 live grantees providing cross-functional support between BLabs, Orb and grantees. Championed co-funding arrangements with Aura Grants. Two TWAMM implementations due to be live next quarter. Notional Finance adding >$3m TVL from $70k grant. More pools to be launched. Funding development of Xeonus' analytics site. Expanding Balancer docs and SDK. Dedication to transparent approvals process and reporting. Recovered Funds from stale grantees to redistribute to new projects. Domain of Operation. The grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects. The Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below. Grants Committee. The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. Burns - Committee Co-Lead. Zen Dragon - Committee Co-Lead. Jay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor. John Grant - Committee Member/Mentor. Mike B - Committee Member/Mentor. Xeonus - Committee Member/Mentor. ZeKraken - Committee Member/Mentor. The Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees. By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi. Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown. This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period January 1st, 2023 until March 31st, 2023. At the end of this cycle (March 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next epoch budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle. Compensation will continue to be paid out in BAL to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee. Tiers are: Committee Lead / Major Contribution - $5,000 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .

A proposal to adjust 2 total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for DAI on Aave V2 Ethereum. Abstract. Following recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121]([link]), [AIP-124]([link]), and [AIP-125]([link])) After mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of DAI. Reducing capital efficiency on v2 assets will mitigate attack vectors while also serving as effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies. As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to make the full implications clear to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the Risk-Off Framework 2 previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat 1) Motivation. The priority of this proposal is not to optimize markets (capital efficiency); but rather to focus on the security and risk mitigation of the protocol. It will be followed up with additional proposals to update risk parameters to reflect the current market conditions accurately. The goal of this ARC is two-fold: Reduce LTs  Reducing liquidation thresholds for DAI effectively reduces capital efficiency and increases the required capital for waging price manipulation attacks on Aave. Encourage user migrations to v3  This also begins to pave the way towards migrating to v3, where these assets can be utilized in E-mode. However, this is a significant change, and we wanted to present data to quantify and visualize the effect of such reductions on protocol users for community discussion.

Author: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2022-10-17. --- Simple Summary. Llama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. The current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1] As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode. This proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens. Utilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45%  72.5% At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAOs revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions. Motivation. With wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost. Increasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300% Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility. The breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative. The capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3] Based upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65% It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65% The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point. The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. ![|602x372]([link] \"Chart\") Specification.

Supplemental Resources: Launch the [Diversified Staked ETH Index]([link]) (dsETH) Fee Split Framework: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework]([link]) Motivation: Since launching over two years ago, Index Coop has established itself as the leader in on-chain structured products. With over 90% of the market share of on-chain indices, we've experienced first-hand the many trends and cycles of crypto. Much like the rest of DeFi, Index Coop has yet to reach escape velocity. Our current slate of products offer users one-click access to the largest sectors of crypto. Our strategies make DeFi simple for users who don't want to constantly manage on-chain positions. Our DAO, however, has been limited in the type of products we can build. Our upcoming suite of products, built and bundled on Managed Balancer Pools, will unlock the advancements and efficiencies of DeFi in a whole new way. In our new partnership, Index and Balancer are positioned to bring the wonders of crypto to all users. The Index Coop team aims to bring Balancer to every corner of the finance world including institutional custodians, TradFi data providers, crypto intermediaries, DeFi money markets, on-chain aggregators, and wallet interfaces. It is time to bring Balancer to the mainstream. In an effort to keep our partnership strong and long-term focused - with both of our communities in mind - Index Coop is proposing: 1. Product fee splits. 2. OTC token swap. 3. Enable veBAL gauges on select products Product fee splits Index Coop is offering Balancer DAO a base of 30% of MBP-level fees for Composite MBPs. For Structured MBPs a base MBP-level fee of 50% will go to Balancer. Composite MBPs will resemble existing composite, Set-based products like DPI. Composite MBPs will typically target a theme, sector, or market and generally have simpler functionality. Structured MBPs will represent a new class of products that utilize the fuller feature set of Managed Pools. These structured MBPs will include tokens built in-house by Index Coop and will generally have more sophisticated functionality compared to Composite MBPs. Upcoming dsETH will be considered a Structured MBP For a full deep dive into the fee arrangements follow this link: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework]([link]) Most Favored Nation status: For any fee split arrangement Balancer gives to any party in the future, Index Coop shall have the right (but not the obligation) to receive the same terms. Token Swap Index Coop is proposing a 1:1 OTC treasury swap 100k INDEX ([currently ~$200k]([link])) for a proportional amount of BAL (a 30dma of each token to be applied upon date of formal agreement) Index Coop will convert the tokens into veBAL using the vested escrow contract, locking them for 1 year We believe in a long-term partnership and propose locking the respective veBAL and INDEX for at least 1 year Index Coop will use these tokens to direct BAL rewards to Index Coop Managed Pools beginning with dsETH. These tokens will be supplemented by ~4,824 veBAL (~$80k) obtained by Index Coop treasury investments into the Balancer Boosted USD Pool. Voting power for INDEX and BAL is planned to be instant, but is contingent on the technical capaiblites of the locking mechanism veBAL Gauges Index Coop is proposing to set up initial gauges for the Diversified Staked ETH Index, Diversified Stable Yield Index, and future Structured MBPs. Over the past few months, we've been inspired by the success of BAL and veBAL. We've already seen with dsETH how our products could bring positive sum dynamics as protocols can add native token incentives to our products and buy/lock veBAL. The Index Coop team intends to be a major advocate for protocols getting into the veBAL game. While the INDEX token does not share these same characteristics, the INDEX token has unique and powerful metagovernance dynamics. Considering the success of the [Aave swap]([link]), this partnership would add voting power at a low cost there and also gain voting power in UNI, COMP, and others that we've used and can continue to use for asset listings. In addition to the metagovernace power, we invite Balancer DAO to use INDEX tokens to influence the direction of product decisions including the composition of future MBPs. Index Coops first managed pool, dsETH, is only the beginning. Our product team is looking forward to increased flexibility as we build future indices and even as we think about redesigning or bundling existing indices. We believe the combination of our technical teams and our added abilities to distribute tokens to custodians and possibly centralized exchanges will open up Balancer to a whole new class of investors. Voting Specifications: We request a vote to decide on the partnership between Index Coop and Balancer DAO. If the community votes YES: The product fee arrangement as specified above will be put into place Index Coop and Balancer DAO will conduct an OTC token swap. BAL will be sent to the Index Coop Treasury Account: [hexadecimals] Initial gauges will be set up for dsETH and DYI. If the community votes NO: Index Coop and Balancer teams will revisit our partnership framework without interfering with the technical development of the products.

Summary: Enable a Balancer gauge for the 2brl - bb-am-usd on Polygon. Following our first proposal ([link]) and after the first feedback, I am also proposing another proposal to add a gauge to the 2brl-bb-am-usd pool as well. (2brl = name of the BRZ-jBRL Stable Pool) BRZ and jBRL are both Brazilian Real stablecoins. BRZ is backed 1:1 by Brazilian Real (BRL) and issued by Transfero. jBRL is backed by various collateral types (BRZ, USDC, etc.) Jarvis Network and Transfero co-write the proposal.

Protocol Description: Jarvis Network. Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a direct or indirect fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi, Monerium, PayTrie etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Midas), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy) Transfero. Transfero Group is an international financial solutions company based on blockchain technology in the Crypto Valley, Switzerland. Its objective is to connect emerging countries to the global market through a platform of financial solutions based on blockchain infrastructure, providing greater efficiency, flexibility, and access for people and businesses. Transfero also developed BRZ, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by Brazilian real (BRL), to give South Americans a reliable asset to the blockchain industry. The BRZ token is live on Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Stellar. BRZ was featured in a World Economic Forum panel in 2020. BRZ is integrated with fiat on and off-ramp (BityPreco) and crypto-card solutions (Wirex) and can be borrowed and lent on money markets (Midas) Motivation: The role of this pool is to connect the 2brl pool, and therefore both jBRL and BRZ to the rest of the Balancer liquidity and to route all the \"external\" swaps through the bb-am-usd pool to increase its natural yield. This will help us improve the capital efficiency of our whole \"on-chain Forex infrastructure\", which is composed of our protocol (Liquidity Pools and Wrappers) and of all the secondary markets' liquidity pools. The pool allows to do not have to launch a jBRL-USD and a BRZ-USD pool for example! Eventually, this pool can bring us a step closer to the \"real yield\" narrative, since it will generate value for the LPs through multiple sources: fees from the 2brl pool fees and interest from the bb-am-usd pool and of course fees from the jBRL <> USD and BRZ <> USD swaps. Additionally, we have deployed a WETH-jBRL pool, so multiple arbitrages will happen between all these pools. A few notes: This is our second proposal to add a gauge to pool containing jBRL and BRZ; we would prefer having two gauges for these two pools (the 2brl pool and the 2brl-bb-am-usd pool) to give LPs the chance to decide whether or not they want to have exposure to USD. Jarvis LTD has started building a position in BAL and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same position. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools to bribe veBAL voters (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot) Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield; this means that we may need to deploy two new gauges in the future, for a new 2brl boosted pool as well as a 2brl-boosted-bb-am-usd pool. This proposal is the first of many, as Jarvis Network is moving all their liquidity pools from Curve (stable pools) and Uniswap/Sushiswap/Kyber (volatile pools) to Balancer. Eventually, we have asked Midas to add the bb-am-usd BPT as collateral to borrow jBRL (an other jFIATs) against it: this would allow the Balancer LPs in this pool to borrow jBRL against it while earning staking rewards (Midas enables to deploy the LP token into staking contract), as well as adding the BPT of the 2brl and 2brl-bb-am-usd pools as collateral. Jarvis will launch a JARVIS-ETH 80/20 pool (our new token) tans use it for our veJARVIS token, as well as a rLBP for our buy back module. We will also launch various smart pool consisting of many different currencies to launch some indexes. Specifications: 1. Governance: Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a \u215d multi-sig (only one team member in the signers) Polygon: [hexadecimals] Ethereum: [hexadecimals] Gnosis Chain: [hexadecimals] BSC: [hexadecimals] Avalanche: [hexadecimals] Optimism: [hexadecimals] Transfero: centralised entity. 2. Oracles: jBRL uses BRLUSD Chainlink price feed; BRZ token does not have a price feed. 3. Audits: Jarvis: [GitBook]([link]) Transfero: 4. Centralizing vector: jBRL is mainly collateralized by USDC; BRZ is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a centralized entity. 5. Market history: jBRL has been live since February 2022 (on the BNB Chain); it has traded a bit off its peg during the FTX crisis due to a too-high supply of jBRL on a money market vs. a too-low number of jBRL minted through the Liquidity Pool (the number of jBRL that you can sell in the Liquidity Pool = the number of jBRL that people has bought; so people borrow a lot of jBRLs from the Credit Line or which have been minted through the Printer, and sell them all through the Liquidity Pool, it can prevent other jBRL holders from selling jBRLs through the pool, preventing any arbitrages from happening) We have solved the issue by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. At the same time, BRZ had an issue with its peg because its primary off-chain market was on FTX, and the pool used a wrapped BRZ from Solana. Besides last weeks event, both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch (on the BNB) We have learned how to prevent these situations from happening again or fix them quickly. Two other rare cases can prevent users from buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pools (again leading to preventing arbitrages from happening), and we also know how to mitigate them (currently working on it as we speak) 6. Value: The 2brl-bb-am-usd pool will act as the main secondary liquidity source for BRZ and jBRL. It will produce a higher natural yield for its LP since the 2brl is also a Balancer pool that act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.) It will be our first step toward moving our ecosystem to Balancers.

Simple Summary: Aave V3 Arbitrum & Optimism markets are currently governed by the Community Guardian, a 6/10 elected multisig of 10 Aave community members with the responsibility to enforce community decisions on snapshot on-chain. This ARC intends to replace the community guardian in favor of Aave governance contracts for the administration of Arbitrum & Optimism V3 markets. Motivation: As cross-chain governance bridges received recent audits and in favor of more decentralization of Aave, this AIP intends to fade the community guardian role in Arbitrum and Optimism V3 markets in favor of Aave governance contracts. This means that if this AIP is validated by Aave governance, every AIP concerning the Arbitrum and OP markets will require an On-chain AIP vote to directly modify the Aave V3 markets on these networks for example onboard a new asset or change an asset risk parameters. The community guardian multisig always has been presented as a temporary solution in the wait of a cross-chain messaging solution allowing the Aave governance contracts to enforce directly onchain with no trusted intermediary for the governance decisions. Fading the guardian role is a step forward in Aave protocol decentralization. if this AIP gathers governance approval, the community guardian will keep an \"emergency failsafe role with the ability to freeze markets or cancel AIPs votes to protect the Aave markets in case of crisis or malicious AIPs. The cross-chain governance bridge contract that allows more decentralization of the Aave protocol has been audited by ChainSecurity and Certora, and a report of the audit of this contract can be found in the technical link section of this AIP. Technical specifications: The cross-chain governance bridges is a set of smart contracts that serve as an extension of the Ethereum Aave Governance, receiving the approved actions by the community in Ethereum, and executing them in the target chain. The details of the actions are described in a message which is passed from the L1 Aave Governance Executor contract using the native messaging mechanism of the chain: For Arbitrum, via creation of a retrayable ticket in the Arbitrum Inbox contract on Ethereum. For Optimism, via sending a message using the OVM L1 Cross Domain Messenger contract on Ethereum. The recipient of the bridged actions are the governance bridge contracts. Once actions reach these contracts, they are registered in the execution queue so they can be executed after a delay period. Queued actions are susceptible to being canceled for a period of time (e.g. grace period) by the Guardian. This is an \"emergency failsafe, a mechanism to protect the market in the target chain in case there is malicious or illegitimate action. This is a last-resort instrument that can be used by the Community Guardian Multisig. A detailed specification of the contracts and workflow is outlined in this repository. Technical Links.

Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put ComposableStable-V2 pools in Recovery Mode. This proposal is follow up to the [original]([link]) to cover the additional pool factory. Motivation. It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to 'getRate' reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pools internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction. In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper]([link]), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts. The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache. When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool. The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts. The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. This set will now include the [ComposableStable-V2]([link]) pool factory deployed in December.

This proposal is to fund Nethermind to deliver a Systematization of Knowledge for Decentralized Identities and Verifiable Credentials. During the project, a dedicated team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is and what solutions are used/planned to be used in practice, and how. The project is one of the steps toward allowing Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. The project will take 6 weeks, and its cost  150 000 DAI  will be covered by Lido DAO. Ideal mechanism overview. An ideal mechanism evaluates Lidos DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in[this note]([link])by Lido. The mechanism has methods for improving the validator set if there is an option to do so. It has zero input from permissioned roles (i.e., there are no admins/committees) And it has an input of low to zero impact from LDO, stETH, and ETH token holders. The mechanism has to be capital efficient: Collateral for operators can be used, but it can't be the single or primary mechanism; it has to function mainly by staking with other peoples money. The mechanism has to account for the bull-bear cycle effect in a way that would allow operators to stop validating if that becomes too expensive for them and for the protocol to contract the number of operators in bear markets and expand in bull markets. The mechanism has to prevent the set of operators from becoming worse. This includes but is not limited to avoiding the following: - reduced performance, - offline time, - slashable offenses, - reduced geodiversity, - reduced Ethereum client diversity and other diversity vectors, - giving up independence (e.g., in a merger), - destructive MEV. - delegation of operation has to reduce the amount of stake that an operator can get, potentially down to removing it from the set altogether. Improving operational quality should increase an operators revenue (by increasing the stake or the commission) The stake should be distributed flat-ish. No operator should control more than 1% of total ETH staked (globally) The mechanism can't overfit on any one parameter, but most importantly, it can't overfit on performance: super-performant operators often cut corners or sacrifice certain attributes for others. There has to be a \"good enough level of performance. The mechanism should allow for a new operator to enter the set of operators with essentially no collateral or reputation and work its way to an optimal position within the network of operators. That should be possible, although it may take a long time, if the operator has a \"good enough performance and is ecosystem aligned, independent, and runs its own hardware in non-concentrated geographical/jurisdictional areas. There might be a need for an insurance pool or collateral to enter at zero or to rise to the top, but it shouldn't be an important requirement in the middle. Objectives. We offer to help Lido with maintaining ahigh-quality validator set. This entails: 1. Designing and implementing methods for assuring that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e. the operator does not hire a white-label node), is a proficient DevOps engineer, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly. 2. Conducting economic analysis to understand how market changes, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can impede the systems security and how to secure the system against unfavorable market changes. The project will be divided into four phases: - Phase 1:We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. See the Roadmap for Phase 1 below for specific details. The proposal focuses solely on this phase. - Phase 2:During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets. - Phase 3: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1, 2, and 3. - Phase 4:This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during Phases 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, we will research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3. About Nethermind. Nethermind is a team of world-class builders & researchers. Our work touches many parts of the industry, from our Nethermind node to[fundamental cryptography research]([link])and[application-layer protocol development]([link]) Motivation. Permissionless operator set. Our research will first focus on ensuring a high-quality set of operators for the Lido network. A light-heartedly created set of operators could put users' stakes at risk or even threaten the security of the Ethereum network. Hence the method for permissionless and secure operators' evaluation, addition, and removal is crucial. Although the whole set of operators should be of high quality, we need to allow newcomers to join the network as well. Newcomers may not have records good enough to be considered of high quality, but they should be able to work their way up to a high-quality status. Another problem to study is how and when to arrange the operators into committees. Since the network allows newcomers that may be of a lower quality, it is essential from the networks performance and security perspectives to ensure that high-quality operators have the required majority of voting power in all validators. Since on-chain data may not be enough to assure a high-quality set of operators, it is important to design a mechanism that pulls off-chain data on-chain. Here we differentiate two sources of data: issuer data and community data. The former is taken from official institutions, trusted issuers, etc. The latter is taken from distributed communities. It is crucial for the data to be obtainable and verifiable. The quality of data determines the quality of the reputation and quality systems. Economic analysis. Another crucial part of assuring a good set of validators is to create a robust incentive mechanism that assures that rational actor behave honestly and in a manner that helps shape the operator set according to our design goals (e.g. having operators be as diverse as possible), being this the behavior with the greatest payoff. To that end, an in-depth analysis of liquid staking economics incentivization methods is required. We also note that an incentive mechanism is needed to obtain good quality data  both to have data pulled on-chain and to have it verified. We also propose to analyze how users' and operators' incentives change if the proposer-builder separation is included in Ethereum. General work mindset. The following principles will drive the development of the protocols: - All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO. - Nethermind will set up a dedicated team for this effort. - All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols' security will be proven. - Milestones and deliverables will be small to assure a good overview of the progress the team makes. Project Objective. Phase 1. Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. Systematization of knowledge. - We will start by investigating classical results in Decentralized Identity Schemes and Verifiable Credentials. - Then we will discuss the recent advancements in these two areas. - Finally, we will investigate what solutions are used in practice (or planner to be used), how projects use them, what are the security assumptions and properties, what are the known roadblocks.

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold, Loan To Value, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | STETH Liquidation Threshold | 81% | 83% | | STETH Loan To Value | 69% | 72% | | STETH Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 7% | | WBTC Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 82% | | WBTC Loan To Value | 70% | 72% | We have ingested the most recent Aave and market data, including user positions, prices, volatility, and liquidity for all assets, including stETH, WETH, and WBTC. We then ran simulations to stress test the protocol in times of high volatility. As shown in the dashboard screenshot below, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while decreasing the risk of bad debt using these parameterization recommendations.

This proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO. Abstract. If approved, this proposal will result in: - Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora. - Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply. - BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply. - Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration. Preface. This proposal is shared by Solaces team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder) Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora) Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Auroras and NEARs ecosystems. Motivation. Both NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there. Background. Solace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M) The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solaces team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer) Specification. Solace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links: - Website (access the app through the link on there): [link] - Smart contracts: [[link]]([link]) Please note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22) Holdr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges. HLDR Supply and Distribution. The total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules: 5% - Balancer. A portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancers treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows: - 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff) - 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows: - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders. - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible. - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum. - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders. - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders. To achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions. 15% - Solace DAO. This allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff. 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury. The Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace teams goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff. 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors. This allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation. 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping. These funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions. Similar to Balancers schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk. Friendly Fork Agreement. If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOERBMdalrIeWW6th9sX0hZYfljo", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953999, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal seeks community support for Solace DAO to launch a Balancer Friendly Fork called Holdr on the Aurora chain.

The main purpose of the PSP token is to scale and govern the ParaSwap protocol. After one year of observation and community feedback, we believe the current system could be improved by addressing its limitations: staking efficiency, liquidity, and sustainable native token emissions. What are we proposing? To achieve these changes, PSP 2.0 proposes the following main ideas: Overhaul the PSP Staking system. Introduce the Social Escrow and reward boosting system (ParaBoost) to reward users with protocol fees instead of PSP.

Status: Discussion. Author: @llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham. Created: 24-10-2022. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves. With the support of the community, Llama will develop ERC4626 strategies that enable Balancer v2 and Curve Liquidity Provider tokens to be deposited as collateral. Users will earn the rewards from the respective Aura Finance and Convex Finance gauges whilst being able to draw a loan against the productive strategies. This new type of collateral is expected to drive borrowing demand for listed assets and generate additional revenue for Aave DAO by sending 5% of the earned rewards to the DAO. Introduction. To support the continued growth of Aave, new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market. Llama proposes onboarding productive assets that are supportive of enhancing capital efficiency through unlocking new utility for user funds. Currently, there is $4.4B deposited in Convex Finance and Aura Finance, and when Optimism enabled liquidity mining on Aave v3, Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave increased almost 13x from $36M to $460M. Llama seeks to create the new type of collateral standard and onboard the first BPT and crvLP as collateral on the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. The new collateral type will be listed with SupplyCaps in place, borrowing disabled, and eMode created to shape how users interact with the new pools. Motivation. To understand how this strategy works, we will first walk through an example that demonstrates the user experience. In this example, the user deposits a BPT into Aave and claims rewards generated by the Aura Finance Gauge. ![|602x137]([link]) The use,r having already invested in a Balancer v2 Liquidity Pool, deposits the BPT into the Aave Reserve and receives back aBPT. The Aave Reserve receives the users BPT and deposits it into an Aura gauge. The rewards generated from staking the BPT in the Aura Finance gauge are claimable by the user without needing to redeem the BPT deposit. When the user claims the rewards, 5% are sent to the DAO and 95% to the user. The productive strategy can also be used as collateral.This creates much more utility for BPTs as users can then borrow against the productive strategy. Apart from levered farming of rewards, users can create buy-now and pay-later strategies that utilize future incentives to pay back the loans. This also creates an opportunity for other communities to build automated strategies that manage rewards and collateralization ratios for users that further streamlines the user experience. ![|602x235]([link]) The DAO can decide if pools such as Balancer Boosted Aave Pool (bb-a-USD) and future GHO pools, (bb-a-USD / GHO) can be listed as collateral. Leverage in this application would exhibit similar recursive behavior to that which is occurring on Optimism and could lead to significant volumes of GHO entering circulation over time. If this was to occur, it would have a positive effect on the DAOs revenue. It is important to note that, although this proposal mentions Balancer and Aura Finance, the same concept applies to Curve and Convex. The initial deployments are to utilize Aura gauges, with a Convex integration to follow. Next Steps. A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral. If the community votes positively for the development of the upgrade to enable the new type of productive collateral to be onboarded, Llama will set about designing and creating the upgrade. Llama will commit to following best practices and working closely with other stakeholders within the community in developing the new collateral type. In the lead up to deployment on the Aave protocol, further governance approval will be required. In the future, the community will also be able to decide via Snapshot whether to provide retroactive funding to reimburse the cost associated with the auditing of the new collateral type and how much funding to provide. A separate Snapshot proposal will emerge where the initial asset listing will be proposed, with contributors such as Gauntlet and others potentially playing a role. Upon agreeing on the initial asset to be listed and whether audit costs are to be reimbursed, an on-chain vote will be submitted for governance approval to transfer funds and introduce the upgrade. This loosely follows the methodology presented in the GHO proposal. Conclusion. This ARC is focused on introducing and getting community feedback on introducing Aaves newest productive collateral to the protocol. We look forward to hearing community feedback on all aspects of this proposal.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOEVwLtQvB5ozVdthRMLTMxPIAh3", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954003, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests introducing a new type of collateral for Aave, a decentralized lending platform.

The proposed pilot programme is the first foray of Olympus in DeFi lending markets and aims to introduce and promote OHM as a borrowable asset. More specifically, through this programme the protocol would mint up to 200k OHM and lend it out (in tranches) on Silo and Euler to test demand and interest rate models. Motivation. Up to this point most integrations of OHM/gOHM in lending markets have focused on the collateral-side. With the recent changes through RBS and the resulting price stability and low volatility, OHM/gOHM are becoming preferred collateral assets to use - as the recent listings on Silo Finance and Fraxlend have shown. At the same time, it is important for the protocol to also start focusing on the lending-side of the market and to promote OHM as a good borrowable asset as well. There are a few different reasons why. For borrowers it diversifies options to borrow \"stable-ish assets beyond just USD stablecoins. For traders and speculators it provides the option to hedge or short OHM, both of which are not easily doable today. While this may seem like a downside, shorting or hedging allows for more natural market dynamics and price discovery, and helps to prevent unsustainable premiums. For Ohmies lending markets also adds additional utility in that they can lend out OHM to interested parties on various lending platforms. More importantly though - from the protocols perspective - is that lending markets allow for more efficient scaling of OHM as well as diversifying the assets that back circulating OHM. Rather than being exclusively backed by treasury assets, OHM minted into credit markets would be backed by a basket of collateral assets (or rather, a claim on those assets) As a result, the OHM supply could theoretically grow without increasing the treasury assets and/or diluting liquid backing of the floating supply. Finally, Olympus will also be earning OHM-denominated yield on OHM that is lent out, creating a new income stream for the protocol. Pilot details. Contracts. Minted OHM for lending markets will be supplied through a lending AMO that is currently under development (and will go into audit afterwards) Depending on the timeline of the contract deployment, this OIP also allows for seeding the initial OHM lending markets through a multisig in order to start these pilot markets as soon as possible. After deploying the lending AMO contracts the multisig would unwind its position, while the lending AMO scales into them. Pilot markets. For this pilot Euler and Silo Finance were selected as the initial lending markets. Both have the option of OHM as a borrowable asset and we've worked with both teams to set an interest rate model that makes sense for the protocol. Euler currently has a TVL of $189m and has been audited by several firms including Halborn, Solidified and ZK Labs, Certora and Sherlock. Collateral assets on Euler (i.e. assets that OHM can be borrowed against) are stablecoins such as USDC, DAI, and USDT, ETH and liquid staking derivatives such as stETH and wstETH, and WBTC. For more information on Euler please see here: [link] Silo Finance is a newer lending market and focuses on isolated lending pools. It currently has a TVL of $22m and has been audited by Certora, ABDK, and Quantstamp. Collateral assets on Silo are ETH and XAI, their stablecoin (currently backed by USDC and ETH) For more information on Silo please see here: [link] Capacity. The maximum OHM minted through the pilot programme is 200k. These funds will not be lent out all at once but instead will be added to the pilot lending markets in tranches, both to see the scaling of demand as well as to manage interest rates (see below) Note that any OHM minted but not borrowed will not increase the circulating supply. Only after a borrower deposits collateral and borrows OHM will this be considered part of the circulating OHM supply. Interest rates. Managing the OHM interest rates in these pilot lending markets will be key. If interest rates are low, it would incentivize users to borrow OHM and stake it, netting the difference between those two rates. If interest rates are high, it obviously discourages people from borrowing OHM in the first place. Through the pilot programme and lending AMO the protocol could add or withdraw liquidity in order to keep the interest rates at a level where it is both profitable for the protocol as well as interesting for the borrower. Euler and Silo both have different interest rate models. The Euler OHM market will have a base interest rate of 5% (at 0% utilization) with a kink interest rate of 20% before increasing exponentially. The Silo interest rate model is still being finalized and works differently than Euler, but at an \"optimal utilization of the market the rate would be close to todays staking rate. Metrics to track. Throughout this pilot programme, the protocol will be tracking key performance metrics. Indicators of success for this pilot would be: - Consistent demand, measured by the of borrowed OHM, as we scale into the markets over time. - Interest rates that are close to or above the staking rate. - Healthy mix of user actions (e.g. is borrowed OHM used for shorting, staking, bonding, et cetera) On top of that we will also track utilization rates, changes in circulating OHM backing (i.e. the ratio PCV-backed vs. collateral-backed OHM), and gross interest rate income for the treasury. Depending on the performance of these pilot markets another OIP can be created to scale the capacity or to add additional lending markets.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOEW0A1G9cUSxbJpAS2NXIPE8mWe", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954004, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposed pilot program aims to introduce and promote OHM as a borrowable asset in DeFi lending markets.

References/Useful links: > Link to:  Website:[link]  Documentation: [link]  Github Page: [link]  Communities: [Twitter]([link]), [Discord]([link]), [Telegram]([link]) Protocol Description: >Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. >Tranchess' fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying assets price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation. >Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. Motivation: > The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience. >A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative. Specifications: 1. Governance: Tranchess' governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchesss snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum]([link]) 2. Oracles: Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle. 3. Audits: Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here]([link]) Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program]([link]) with Immunefi. 4. Centralization vectors: The token is not upgradeable or pausable. The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract. Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators. 5. Market History: Link to the pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Link to the gauge: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) 6. Value: The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess.

Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon. Dated: 2022-11-05. --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 (when deployed) Liquidity Pools. Abstract. With Aave v3 about to be deployed on Ethereum and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1 where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile. The new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to just replicating the v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category. For the existing v2 market, @llamaxyz suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters as being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO. Motivation. By changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3 the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2. By setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75%, 25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield, utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time. By reducing the Slope 2 parameter, from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80% This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0% With the new Interest Rate curve recommended for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3% Because of this, it is recommended to also change the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency. The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. ![|602x372]([link] \"Chart\") This proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. Prior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, the Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post merge despite utilization within the Reserve increasing significantly over that time, [2] Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed. |Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)| | --- | --- | --- | |Uoptimal|70|80| |Base|0|0| |Slope1|3.0|5.75| |Slope2|100|80| |Reserve Factor|10|15| References.

The zkSync team will submit a snapshot to launch Aave V3 on ZkSync V2 testnet, and thereafter another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met) zkSync ecosystem has over 200 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc. Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation. zkSync shares Ethereums ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership About zkSync zkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup]([link]) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security. zkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers: EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps. ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools. Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source. Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability. Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code. There is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSyncs EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.

In the pursuit of decentralization and a sustainable protocol work, it is proposed to expand Lido on Ethereum Oracle set with third parties. This a proposal to expand the set, increase quorum and also compensate oracles gas costs retrospectively and further gas costs on a regular basis. Current state. Existing Oracle set consists of 5 participants, all of them are Lido DAO approved Node Operators. Quorum is 3/5 now. This means that the report finalization with rebase only occurs when there are 3 identical reports from oracles. [[link]]([link]) The oracle set expansion. Option 1: onboard 6 oracles and set quorum as 6/11. This a proposal to onboard following 6 new oracles to the Oracles set. All of them at the moment are not Lido DAO approved Node Operators, and this leads to the decentralization of the protocol, because the current oracle set, consisting of five node operators, will be supplemented by six third-party oracles: 1. [Rated]([link]) 2. [bloXroute]([link]) 3. [Instadapp]([link]) 4. [Kyber Network]([link]) 5. [Matrixed.Link]([link]) 6. [Spire Blockchain]([link]) The quorum will be increased from 3/5 to 6/11. Option 2: onboard 4 oracles and set quorum as 5/9. This vote also proposes an option that came up during the discussion on the forum: onboard only 4 instead of 6 oracles. In this case, those potential oracles that are node operators in other protocols will not get into the set. We will be happy to further cooperate with them as node operators. In this case, the following set is offered for onboarding: 1. [Rated]([link]) 2. [bloXroute]([link]) 3. [Instadapp]([link]) 4. [Kyber Network]([link]) Quorum will be set as 5/9. Gas cost compensation. It is proposed to compensate retrospectively gas costs for existing 5 oracles and further gas costs for the whole set. For this purpose will be used 2/3 multisig wallet '[hexadecimals]', which was created as a result of [the Snapshot vote]([link]) Funds already owned by multisig will be used, no additional funding is required for oracle purposes. Total amount of 25.91 ETH will be transferred from the multisig to the following addresses to compensate for costs already incurred: | Address | Amount, ETH | | --- | --- | | x007de4a5f7bc37e2f26c0cb2e8a95006ee9b89b5 | 7.244 | | x140bd8fbdc884f48da7cb1c09be8a2fadfea776e | 3.393 | | x1d0813bf088be3047d827d98524fbf779bc25f00 | 5.003 | | x404335bce530400a5814375e7ec1fb55faff3ea2 | 4.645 | | x946d3b081ed19173dc83cd974fc69e1e760b7d78 | 5.625 | For further compensation, gas costs will be funded through the multisig '[hexadecimals]'under already approved budget.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nKarpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal. Background. This is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO]([link]) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way. Karpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. Our operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \\ Also, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancers needs. \\ Karpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap]([link]) As a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings. Motivation. In order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \\ An idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values) Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework. The chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkeys strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together. ![Karpatkey Participation [image]]([link]) Source: [Autonolas]([link]) independent research (link to original report [here]([link])) Core Proposal. Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy. The process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions' call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAOs custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkeys intervention. If Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn't included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \\ An alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary. We would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss. Karpatkey DAOs professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market. Daily Strategy Reevaluation. Each step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. Impermanent/Divergence Loss. To minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks: Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets' correlation evolution) Definition of thresholds for exit strategies Accurate IL tracking, also considering different variations of deposited volumes over time. The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but its primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability. ![IL [image]]([link]) Impermanent loss evolution tracking example: ![IL [image]]([link]) Treasury Core Unit. After reviewing Balancer DAOs structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAOs support. \\ The CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAOs payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others): Balancer Value Proposition: Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury Availability: Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets Liquidity: Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact Balancer Health Monitoring: Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued Fund Proposals: Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly Fund OPEX: All of Balancer DAOs operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol: In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure its ready to be executed at all times Capital Optimisation: CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below) Reporting: Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification Bridge Monitoring: analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction. Yield Strategy. The yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don't do trading. In alignment with Balancers treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAOs preferences and risk profile: Aave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit. Reporting. Karpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information. The following metrics would be included: Portfolio Summary: shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets Revenues: shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance Positions: shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues Loans Management: shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio Portfolio details: shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset Improvement Proposals: shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal Incentives program: shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol. Fees. Karpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAOs growth: Management fee. A yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO. Performance fee. We'd charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer. Termination. Balancer may terminate Karpatkey DAOs engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four weeks notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination. Custody of Funds. Karpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won't suffice to execute transactions. Karpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and \"selfish-mining attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO. The plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions. Dependencies. Upon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancers Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \\ Alternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit. Risk Assessment. Risk Management. Every decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.

(sorry for the redacted links, having to work around the 2 links per post limit) Protocol Description: THX Network allows organizations to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their software platforms, increasing engagement and enabling new revenue streams. $THX is the protocols governance token and its active on both Polygon and Ethereum mainnet. At $0.04 the $THX token sits near all-time-high (ATH) against ETH. The project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS) And is part of the Techstars + ABN AMRO Future of Finance Amsterdam 2022 cohort. Motivation: The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity, created after the first Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) launch using Copper on Polygon working closely with Alchemist and Copper team members at the time (dec. 2021) The 80/20 pool has had up to 0.3% of the vote The new 50/50 THX/stMATIC pool is established so that it aligns with the BIP19 initiative THX Network DAO and $BAL In closing, our DAO has acquire $BAL and (decided mid June, see gov[]thx.network/t/diversify-20k-community-treasury-usdc-into-bal-vebal/51) and has its multisig address ([hexadecimals]) whitelisted for governance.

Audits: docs[]thx.network/other/audits. 4. Centralization vectors: our API and single sign-on (SSO) infrastructure introduces some centralization in exchange for better UX. Overview docs[]thx.network/developers/network. Pools implement a RelayHub for executing signed transactions on behalf of our wallet. A single key is permitted to forward those signed transactions to the RelayHub. Context and mitigation: Private keys used by our backends are stored as encrypted secrets in our AWS parameter store. This store is only accessible with proper IAM access configuration. Two core team members are currently bearing those roles. Our authorization backend (OAuth2 OIDC) utilizes Torus network for private key distribution in our Web Wallet. Context and mitigation: we have added Metamask authentication for power users and are implementing Metamask transaction signing in our Web Wallet. 5. Market History: the $THX token launched at $0.12 and currently sits at $0.04 and near all-time-high (ATH) against ETH. The 80/20 pool has been active since dec. 2021 and generated $1.6M in volume since then. It has about $800k in TVL. Pool [hexadecimals] (Polygon) Gauge [hexadecimals] 6. Value: The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity. The pool usually ranks number 10 by TVL and fees collected on Polygon. The 50/50 THX/stMATIC pool has just been seeded with $30k liquidity by the multisig and soon another ~$35k will be moved from Uniswap to this Balancer pool by the DAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

There is no reason not to claim the tokens, and doing so will add additional assets to the 1inch DAO Treausury. This proposal also allows for the 1inch DAOs interests to be represented in SafeDAO via vote delegation. Specification. Delegate Address: 'Stablelab.eth' -- [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Safesnap Transaction Data: ' [ { \"to\": \"[hexadecimals]\", \"operation\": \"0\", \"value\": \"0.0\", \"data\": \"[hexadecimals]\" }, { \"to\": \"[hexadecimals]\", \"operation\": \"0\", \"value\": \"0.0\", \"data\": \"[hexadecimals]\" }, { \"to\": \"[hexadecimals]\", \"operation\": \"0\", \"value\": \"0.0\", \"data\": \"[hexadecimals]\" }] ' Rationale. As part of the [stage-2 governance]([link]) launch, the powers of the 1inch DAO treasury multisig owners are limited to emergency cases only. In order for the 1inch DAO Treasury to make any transaction, a vote needs to occur. SafeSnap will be used to execute this off-chain SnapShot vote in a trust-minimized fashion. A full description of this process can be seen in the governance documentation: [Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap]([link]) Delegation. During the [phase-1 discussion]([link]), StableNode and DAOplomats agreed that the team with the least amount of SAFE delegation on Monday October, 10th should be set as the delegate. There were no objections to this suggestion. StableNode currently has 0 SAFE delegated to their address, so they have been selected as delegate. Considerations. There are no costs associated with this proposal. If passed, the proposal will add 10,128.65 SAFE to the 1inch DAO Treasury. This proposal does not call for spending these SAFE tokens, only the claiming of them and the delegation of the voting power. Any use of these funds will require an additional proposal.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across four (4) Aave V2 assets. Abstract. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level]([link]) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. For more details, please see [Gauntlets Parameter Recommendation Methodology]([link]) and [Gauntlets Model Methodology]([link]) Supporting Data on Aave V2 Top 30 borrowers' aggregate positions & borrow usages !([link]]) Top 30 borrowers' entire supply !([link]]) Top 30 borrowers' entire borrows !([link]]) Top USDC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios: !([link]]) Top WETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios: !([link]]) Top AAVE non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios: !([link]]) Top UNI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios: !([link]]) Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification. Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. | Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | | --- | --- | --- | | USDC Liquidation Threshold | 88% | 89% | | USDC Loan To Value | 85.5% | 87% | | WETH Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 86% | | AAVE Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 73% | | AAVE Loan To Value | 62.5% | 66% | | UNI Liquidation Treshold | 75% | 77% | | UNI Loan To Value | 60% | 65% | As shown in the below chart and dashboard screenshot, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while also decreasing the risk of bad debt. These liquidation threshold increases, assuming unit elasticity, result in a projected increase of $8.22M in total borrows across assets. The following chart breaks down the top projected borrow increases by symbol: !([link]]) Risk Dashboard. The community should use Gauntlets [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard]([link]) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard]([link]) Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. These parameter changes increase borrow usage by 18 basis points, decrease VaR by $1.71M and increase LaR by $2.39M. Aave V2 Dashboard. !([link]]) Next Steps Targeting an AIP on 2022-09-27.

References/Useful links: - Website: [Main Website]([link]) [Vaults dApp]([link]) - Documentation: [Gitbook]([link]) - Github Page: [[link] 1]([link]) - Twitter: [link] - Discord: [Discord]([link]) Protocol Description: BadgerDAO is a well established DAO building the infrastructure for Bitcoin in DeFi. Badger Vaults currently have over $80m in TVL as well with more TVL spread across DeFi in Badger created liquidity. Badger also has ibBTC, the number 5 Bitcoin synthetic in defi. BADGER is the governance token of BadgerDAO which allows for users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO. Holding BADGER allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the Badger Vaults ecosystem. Price History: $BADGER, Price History for BADGER can be found on [coingecko]([link]) Motivation: Badger would like to create liquidity with a BADGER / ETH pairing. This gauge will provide a yielding opportunity for BADGER holders who want to pair with ETH. It will also provide more efficient liquidity that will increase Balancer trading volumes and fees because of arbitrage opportunities between this gauge and the BADGER/wBTC gauge. Also, Balancer and BADGER LPs will earn the rETH staking rewards from the pool. Badger is a supporter of, and believer in, censorship resistance. We believe that the Rocketpool model of decentralized, permissionless node operations and staking are the future of privacy and security. It is for this reason that we selected rETH for pairing in this LP. Incentivization of the [BADGER/rETH 50/50 Pool]([link]) will attract meaningful amounts of liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. We're interested in having a diverse set of exchanges which support the BADGER token liquidity and giving Badger supporters many opportunities to earn fees and yield on their tokens. Balancer is our preferred DEX partner for this pair. Specifications: 1. Governance: Proposal: Any member of the community can propose improvements to governance or tokenomics in our Discord Council: Badger has a community elected governance council who helps community members refine their proposals. This includes seeking broad community feedback through a Discord RFF process Forum Signaling and Snapshot: The proposal is posted on the Badger Forum when it is well formed, technical viability has been assessed and suitable alternatives or variations have been identified. After the community has provided feedback on the forum the proposal is updated, if needed, and a decision is made to take the proposal to a snapshot vote. BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked here: [Badger Multisigs]([link]) The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions. 2. Oracles: 2. Badger does not rely on any external oracles. 3. Audits: Audits have been performed by multiple top tier audit agencies. Web2 has been fully audited and reviewed by Halborn and we have an ongoing relationship with Quantstamp and code4rena. Badger Audits can be found on [badger.com]([link]) here: [Security & Audits]([link]) 4. Centralization vectors: Badger does use upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer, though these are protected by a 2 day time lock for prevention of issues. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities and we are releasing an IPFS hosted access point titled \"Chadger that is fully permissionless. BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts handling operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail here: [Badger Multisigs]([link]) Our DeFi pools do not liquidate users and so there are no liquidation risk vectors. 5. Market History: The BADGER token has been actively trading since December 2020. Price movements are largely correlated to the price of BTC and to the overall crypto market cycles. BADGER currently trades on Balancer and Curve in a BADGER+BTC pair as well as large positions in Univ V2, V3 The Balancer pair has a TVL $7m and Curve has a TVL of $2.7m. Volume regularly approaches 1% / day. Comparable pairs have had >$1m daily average volume during this time across Uni v2/3 and Sushi. We believe this gauge will bring consistent volume and fees to Balancer. Badger has been actively trading since December 2020. Badger valuation has moved in step with the markets, bear and bull. Pool: [Balancer Pool]([link]) Gauge w/10% emissions cap: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) 6. Value: This pool will be the primary source of liquidity for BADGER paired with ETH. It will also provide arbitrage trading with the BADGER/wBTC pool.

The BiLira team would like to submit a proposal to onboard TRYB. The purpose of this AIP is to list BiLira (TRYB), the only and 1:1 Turkish Lira-backed stablecoin, on AAVE V3, Avalanche Network, Isolation Mode. References: Link to: [Project]([link]) [Whitepaper]([link])pdf) Token Contracts: [Ethereum]([link])[Avalanche]([link])[Polygon]([link])[Solana]([link])[BNB]([link]) [Dune Analytics Dashboard]([link]) Paragraph Summary: The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is available on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of open internet has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely and effortlessly share value and this created a need for non-USD stablecoins. We want to add TRYB to AAVE V3. Motivation: BiLira offers every Turkish citizen a seamless connection to the decentralized internet. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of the open internet - a fundamental network of information that is free and accessible to everyone regardless of financial motives - has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely, and effortlessly share information. The contributions to this advancement are immense and its impact is still unraveling around the world. Today, crypto assets and blockchain technology provide the means to transfer assets globally, securely, and at a low cost. Establishing an open internet based on value exchange can pave the way for a seamless, borderless and integrated world, which can eliminate barriers that enable the development of a global marketplace that is both economical and inclusive of everyone. Specifications: 1.What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? BiLira Team is the author of the AIP and the Asset. 2.Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. BiLira goes through regular audits performed by independent 3rd parties which can be found [here]([link]) BiLira (TRYB) TRYB is a Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. BiLira aims to bridge the gap between web 2.0 (monetized by fiat) and web 3.0 (fueled by crypto assets), to offer a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. The legacy financial system is dependent on private organizations and third-party services which makes it challenging for individuals to connect to the open internet and transact with one another. The current infrastructure does not support a transition from Web 2.0 banking system to the Web 3.0 crypto-based native web currencies. Since mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile, the public is looking for a better way that is more stable and safe to interact with digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Just as information flows freely between web browsers, BiLira aims to make transferring value between wallets effortless, instant, and borderless for everyone. 3.Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? TRYB (BiLira) is a great fit both as a borrow and collateral asset for the Aave ecosystem. AAVE will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community by listing the reliable and only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin, TRYB (BiLira) Turkey was the worlds fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. By enabling this user base to be able to use their currency as collateral, Aave will welcome a lot of new users to enter into DeFi. There are also multiple institutional and retail players that want to borrow TRYB to market make in Turkish Lira denominated crypto markets. 4.Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?) products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The stablecoin TRYB(BiLira) was released in early 2020. As it is a 1:1 fiat backed stablecoin doesn't have any pegging issues due to its nature. 5.How is the asset currently used? Advanced fiat on/off-ramp: BiLira offers a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high price volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. BiLira builds a fiat <> crypto on/off ramp for users to interact with global exchanges and DEXs as it is the only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. Global coverage: It will allow Turkish Users to participate on Aave with only a domestic bank transfer. Aave will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community. Turkey was the worlds fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. Turkey topped a million trades a day by the end of 2021. With over 40 exchanges operating in Turkey, the Middle Easts largest economy and home to around 85mn people, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is ever expanding. Turkish residents using cryptocurrencies were recorded at 16% to 20% between 2020 and 2022. Latest surveys show there are over 5 to 6 million Turkish people with cryptocurrency accounts. A cryptocurrency exchange in the country reported nearly 5 million users and had a trading volume of $203.5 million. Towards Decentralization: Turkish crypto users generally start their crypto journey through the local exchanges because they do not have to deal with the complexities of the blockchain technicalities, such as use of wallets and addresses. The BiLira team believes in the future of the Web3 decentralized ecosystem, where users control their assets via their own wallets, removing intermediaries and interacting with DeFi. 6.Emission schedule. BiLira is always fully collateralized and backed 1:1 by TRY fiat reserves. 7.Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY) There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB. -MasterMinter - adds and removes minters and increases their minting allowance (2 out of 3) -Minters - create and destroy tokens (2 out of 3) -Pauser - pause the contract, which prevents all transfers, minting, and burning (2 out of 3) -Blacklister - prevent all transfers to or from a particular address, and prevents that address from minting or burning (2 out of 3) -Owner - re-assign any of the roles except for admin (2 out of 3) -Admin - upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself (2 out of 3) The signers of the Multisig are the cofounders of the BiLira Company. 8.Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity) Daily trading volume, market capitalization, and other relevant analytics. -Total Issuance: 3,782,105,670 TRY. -Total Redemption: 3,642,521,623 TRY. -TRYB AUM: 139,584,047 TRY. -Fiat Reserves: 139,584,047 TRY. -Total on-chain transfer volume: 30,002,670,196 TRYB. -Listed on FTX, MEXC, Bitget, Bittrex, Liquid, Pangolin and DFX. -Oracle data for TRYB is available on Chainlink. 9.Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github) [Twitter]([link]) [Telegram]([link]) [LinkedIn]([link]) [Youtube]([link]) [Instagram]([link]) [News: Crunchbase]([link]) [News: Cointelegraph]([link]) [Conferences: Converge22]([link]) The total size of the media community is over 50,000+ users across all social media platforms.

Besides possible smart-contract risks,TRYB stablecoins are backed by fiat TRY and therefore, are the subject to fiat currency risk. Risk Analysis. -There is no regulation on stablecoins in Turkey. BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey. Users need to go through the KYC and AML process. -There haven't been any hacks or vulnerabilities on the project. -The contract is verified on the explorers mentioned above in market statistics. -The project can't be considered a security as TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY) There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB.

The market is risk-isolated by design, ensuring depositors are not affected by contagion in other markets. This liquidity can be removed at the behest of the BalancerDAO at any time and would provide additional revenue to the BalancerDAO treasury. Silo Finance has been an active ecosystem participant in Balancer via Oracle Integration and providing voting incentives to veBAL holders. Silo Finance will reciprocate the BalancerDAOs liquidity seeding by providing $100,000 XAI into the Balancer Silo. Silo Finances smart contracts are fully formally verified by Certora and have undergone audits by Quantstamp and ABDK. Background. Silo Finance is a non-custodial lending protocol that creates risk-isolating money markets. In our lending protocol, each market - we call it a silo - consists of a base asset such as $BAL and two bridge assets, ETH and a stablecoin XAI (pronounced /z\u012b/) Borrowers in each silo (market) are only exposed to the risk of 3 assets at any time rather than all the assets in the protocol. This secure design of money markets protects borrowers against lending hacks, as experienced in previous exploits of Cream Finance, Venus protocol, and recently, Mango Markets. Because our isolated silos don't share risk, the Silo lending protocol can theoretically create unlimited money markets. Our implementation of money markets is drastically different from shared-pool lending protocols like Compound and Aave, where all token assets sit in one market only. As such, if one token asset is manipulated, the entire protocol becomes at risk of insolvency. The $BAL silo. The Silo protocol today lists a risk-isolated market for $BAL consisting of three assets: $BAL-ETH-XAI. This means users can do the following for example: Deposit $BAL into the BAL silo. Borrow ETH from the BAL silo. Deposit the borrowed ETH into the WBTC silo. Borrow WBTC from the WBTC silo. Because both BAL and WBTC silos are isolated, any manipulation of the WBTC silo will not impact $BAL depositors. Soon, $BAL depositors will be able to borrow any of our 68 assets while limiting their risk to one market at a time. Core Proposal. We aim to create a deep borrow/lend $BAL market for users valuing security. Users of the BAL silo will never have to share the risk with users depositing and borrowing in other markets. To build a deep market, we are asking the Balancer DAO to Silo Finance would like to request an allocation of 16,500 $BAL Tokens to the Balancer Silo by the treasury. Seeding the pool would help to grow Balancers Ecosystem and bolster its liquidity in lending markets. SiloDAOs Credit Line. If the proposal is successful, the Silo DAO will make $100,000 XAI available to $BAL depositors. In addition to making yield on $BAL deposits, depositors can borrow the stablecoin to leverage their positions. Silo has taken substantial steps to further integrate with the Balancer Ecosystem, being one of the only lending markets to have a Balancer Oracle integration and providing incentives to veBAL voters for its SILO-ETH Pool. Risk Assessment. The core team has formally verified the entire protocols contracts, including price oracles, using Certora. The Silo protocol has been audited by two auditors, Quantstamp and ABDK. Security reports [link] Specifications - On-Chain Instructions. To deposit $BAL into the Balancer silo, the treasury multi-sig would need to do the following: 1. Approve BAL transfer to BAL silo [hexadecimals] 2. Call deposit(address _asset, uint256 _amount, bool _collateralOnly) on Silo contract ([hexadecimals]) where _asset is BAL address, _amount is amount of BAL deposited and _collateralOnly is false.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Author: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2022-12-17. --- Simple Summary. Llama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. The current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1] As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode. This proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens. Utilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45%  72.5% At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAOs revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions. Motivation. With wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost. Increasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300% Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility. The breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative. The capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3] Based upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65% It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65% The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point. The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. ![|602x372]([link] \"Chart\") Specification.

Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. Summary. In cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to ICHIs Uniswap v3 management protocols ([link])) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network. Boba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute ([link]) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Bobas Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today. In addition, Boba Network is the first and only multichain ([link]) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team. Proposal. We believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include: Ethereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap. Low cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereums strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum. Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3. Boba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows: The incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network. Security. Boba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimisms Optimistic Rollup codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Bobas state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1. The bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1) In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the \"challenge window) In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and theres a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed. The Boba Network codebase and Optimisms codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities. More details about Boba Network can be found on our engineering roadmap. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Timeline. After passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network, we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote. Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba Network. Yes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba. No - Make no Change. Conclusion. Boba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth. We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback!

Deploy Uniswap V3 to zkSync. Summary. To support Uniswaps multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community. zkSync ecosystem has over 100 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc. Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation. zkSync shares Ethereums ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership. We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. About zkSync. zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup ([link]) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security. zkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers: EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps. ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools. Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source. Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability. Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code. There is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSyncs EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution. Security & Bridges. ZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. While developers are free to build their own bridge for any token, zkSync 2.0 has two default trustless bridges (one for ETH and one for ERC20 tokens) The bridges support arbitrary message passing and are secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus. Fraudulent messages are not possible. The only actions a malicious actor could take is to censor messages, confirm inclusion in a block and then discard the state change. Security is top of mind for zkSync ([link]) We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program ([link]) Proposal. Theres significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswaps place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem ([link]) Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswaps influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups. While the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the networks adoption and in turn, Uniswaps usage. License Exemption. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community for a license exemption. Governance at deployment will be subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control facilitated by the messaging bridge ([link]) Timeline. Following the Temperature Check, Consensus Check, and Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync. zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet early October ([link]) A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because its fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswaps relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Bridge validators can't pass an incorrect message or change the content, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we'll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity. Security is top of mind for zkSync. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program. Proposal. Theres significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswaps place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswaps influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups. While the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the networks adoption and in turn, Uniswaps usage. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Matter Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on zkSync provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs through the \"Deploy Uniswap V3 Script albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team. Timeline. Following the Consensus Check and Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync. zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet early October. A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because its fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswaps relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WODnLdDxh8vhcbdJjROHlcpSXMI1", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687953959, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Penn Blockchain (FranklinDAO) is proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync 2.0, a ZK rollup that offers lower transaction costs and increased scalability for Ethereum-based applications.

The goal of these vaults is to allow ETH exposure to increase decentralization but reduce the overall volatility of ETH. Upon approval we will deposit 150E (~$225k) each into the two available Opyn strategies (Crab USDC and Zen Bull) Following six months of deposit period, we will share the performance of these two deposits - the vaults automatically rebalance MWF. Background: OIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. This proposal seeks to add Opyns Crab V2 Strategy to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap. As this is a whitelist proposal, a risk analysis was performed and can be found below. About Crab: Opyn is a DeFi options protocol and the team that designed and developed the smart contracts for Squeeth, a power perpetual tracking ETH2 in the form of the ERC-20 oSQTH. Crab is an automated short-volatility, delta-neutral vault strategy that allows depositors to reap the benefits of shorting oSQTH without taking a view on if the price of ETH will move up or down. By creating a mix of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral, Crab earns returns in USD terms when price of ETH fluctuates within a relatively stable range with periods of low volatility (compared to market expectations) The vault regularly rebalances via a recurring batch auction that allows Crab to buy or sell a target amount of oSQTH to neutralize delta. More about Crab V2: Overview. Auction Example. Depositing, Withdrawing, & Hedging. FAQs. Squeeths Delta. Motivation: Crab V2 provides a short volatility, delta-neutral strategy that aims to earn returns on the treasurys plethora of idle ETH assets. Delta-neutrality can allow the treasury to earn USD-denominated returns without taking a position on the price of ETH itself. The treasury is currently long ETH and recent market fluctuations have frequently oscillated the dollar value of the treasury. The delta-neutral strategy aims for (1) rapid drops in ETH price to have a less significant impact on the Olympus treasurys dollar value and (2) generating USD-denominated returns when ETH moves less than peoples expectations (between hedges) Risks: Vulnerability: A vulnerability in the Crab V2 or Squeeth smart contracts could lead to partial or complete loss of funds. Crab V2 has been audited and is insured by Sherlock and Squeeth has been audited by Trail of Bits and Akira. Liquidation: While Crab Strategy deposits can be liquidated if it falls below the safe-collateralization ratio of 150%, rebalancing on a time-based or ETH-price-changes threshold helps prevent a liquidation from occurring. Crab has never been liquidated to date. ETH Price Movement & Volatility: If there are changes to implied volatility or the price of ETH moves by more than is implied by the Squeeth funding, Crab can lose money. Slippage: Crab can experience slippage when rebalancing (depending on clearing price from the batch auction) or due to price impact when deposits trigger a Uniswap sell. Protocol Analysis: Using a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data.

References: [GitHub - 1inch/erc20-pods 7]([link]), [GitHub - 1inch/farming 5]([link]), [GitHub - 1inch/delegating 1]([link]) Simple Summary. --- This proposal seeks to implement a new Staking Pod mechanic for the 1INCH token. This system will consist of: - Incentivised time-locked 1INCH staking. - Permissionless delegation pods. - Reward distribution compatibility. - 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO protocol revenue shall be distributed to stakers. Abstract. --- With the Staking Pod system, users lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to get st1INCH tokens --- the longer the lock period, the more st1INCH tokens the user gets. st1INCH tokens can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance, and the 1inch DAO can choose to use these token balances for reward distribution. The system is modular as anyone can launch a new Modular Delegation Pod and can use the reward functionality to incentivize certain actions and/or assign utility to the 1INCH token. 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue shall be distributed to stakers. Motivation. --- 1INCH token is the governance token of the 1inch Network. It provides voting rights within the 1inch DAOs governance system, and users can stake it to receive a [refund 3]([link]) on their transaction fees. However, despite these functions, the amount of 1INCH tokens currently being held in [staking contracts is quite low]([link]) and governance participation is even lower. We believe that this is due to a lack of incentives to participate in governance and a lack of additional utility for staked 1INCH. By introducing Modular Staking Pods, we hope to give stakers more direct control over how their stake is used to power the 1inch Network. This change will allow them to independently select how their stake governs each of the protocols and will allow for rewards to permissionlessly be distributed based on the actions of the stakers. We envision that this will improve the goverance by aligning incentives between people who want to stake to earn rewards and those who are interested in protocol governance -- both players will have direct incentives to participate in the same system. We believe that this proposal represents a step forward for the 1inch Network and that it will help increase adoption and usage of the networks future protocols. Specification. --- !([link]) Staking. Like the existing 1INCH staking contract, users will be able to lock their 1INCH tokens in the staking contract to get st1INCH tokens that can be used for 1inch DAO governance. However, unlike the current system, Modular Staking will require users to lock their 1INCH for a set amount of time. Locking. The minimum and maximum lock periods are chosen by the DAO through --- for the purposes of analysis, we'll use 1 month and 2 years as the minimum and maximum staking periods respectively. st1INCH tokens grant users \"voting power\" which they can use for various use cases. The longer the locking period the more \"voting power\" resolver can get. However, the increase in power is not linear. ![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885266-y]([link]) There will be a minimum locking period of 1 month. Note that st1INCH voting power will decay over time according to the locking curve. Also note that users can re-lock their stake at any time to refresh their st1INCH balance. Users will be able to withdraw their stake early but will forfeit a portion of their rewards. ![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885267-y]([link]) Orange is the amount lost when a staker withdraws earlier than they originally committed. Example: - In 2023, Sally stakes 100 1INCH and selects a 2-year lock period. - They receive 100 st1INCH from the staking contract and this balance decays over time. - By 2024 Sallys st1INCH balance has decayed to 22.36. - Sally then chooses to re-lock her stake for the maximum amount of time, 2-years, and her st1INCH balance is increased to 100. - Sally chose not to re-lock, and in 2026, after the lock period, she withdraws her original 100 1INCH. Unlocking. If a st1INCH staker wishes to unlock they will forfeit some of their tokens based on the following equation: withdrawalAmount = (balance - votingPower) / 0.9. penalty = balance - withdrawalAmount. In this setting, the maximum early withdrawal loss is 90% as the minimum locking period is 1 month. Admin Control. The 1inch DAO Treasury Address, [[hexadecimals]]([link]), would act as admin of the staking contract with control over the following functions: - setFeeReceiver -- this would allow the DAO to change the vault to collect the rewards for later distribution between stakers and the DAO treasury. - setDefaultFarm -- this would allow the DAO to change the default reward distribution contract for 1INCH staking. - setMaxLossRatio -- this would allow the DAO to change the earliest point at which people can early withdraw their stake by disallowing withdrawals with larger withdrawal fees. - setEmergencyExit -- This is basically an abort function and would allow the DAO to end the staking scheme. All stakers can reclaim the entire amount of their original stake regardless of their remaining locking period. This would be used if the DAO wanted to migrate to a new staking contract to change key variables, like the maximum lock period. Modular Delegation. The Modular Delegation system provides users with a set of delegation contracts that are specific to a topic. The set of delegation contracts is permissionless, meaning that anyone can deploy one and allow users to delegate their st1INCH within it. The 1inch DAO will have the power to endorse a delegation contract and feature it in the 1inch staking UI. For the start, we propose just two delegation topics: Snapshot governance delegation - This will allow users to delegate their Snapshot voting power to a recognized delegate from the UI, or manually enter an Ethereum/ENS address. - Nested within this is the vanilla[Snapshot space-specific delegation contract 1]([link]) st1INCH utility delegation - As part of this staking upgrade, there will be a new protocol added to 1inchs suite of DeFi tools that will substantially improve the utility of st1INCH. - Service providers that want to tap into the utility of st1INCH can proposition the community for delegated power. Rewards. Modular Staking will have two levels of reward functionality: Generic st1INCH rewards and Modular Delegation rewards. Generic st1INCH rewards. The st1INCH contract will allow anyone to run a farm to distribute rewards to everyone holding st1INCH tokens. Users also have the ability to to join as many farms as they want as it does not required a user to move their st1inch to a specific farm. Along as a user holds st1inch in their account, they can receive rewards from multiple farms. This proposal calls for 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue to be distributed to stakers in the form of 1INCH. Modular Delegation rewards. Some Modular Delegation contracts have an integrated rewards function that anyone can run a farm atop. The main advantage to this type of reward is that it is not limited to being proportional to a users st1INCH holdings. Any action, onchain or offchain, can be used as the basis of reward distribution. This functionality could be used by the 1inch DAO to incentivize anything from editing 1IPs to using a new 1inch protocol (and everything in between) Example: The 1inch DAO may use the Snapshot governance delegation contract to incentivize active governance participation by boosting the st1INCH rewards of people who vote on proposals, delegate their st1INCH to active voters, etc. Rationale. --- The rationale for this proposal is to provide a more flexible staking system that can be used to incentivize various activities within the 1inch Network. The new Modular Delegation contracts will allow for rewards to be distributed based on anything from voting on proposals to using new 1inch protocols. This will provide a greater incentive for users to participate in the network and help drive adoption of new 1inch products and services. Considerations. --- The security considerations for this proposal are mainly around the potential for abuse of the new staking and delegation contracts. It is important to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent users from delegating their voting power to malicious actors. The governance considerations for this proposal include the impact on revenue streams and changes to the governance processes. This proposal could potentially increase revenue for the 1inch DAO if it is successful in incentivizing more users to participate in the network. It is also worth considering how these changes will impact existing voting processes within the 1inch DAO since the existing staking contract will be deprecated.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOEjKA1lfLiVrProFaHDITkeMJC5", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954017, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests implementing a new Staking Pod system for the 1INCH token.

Author: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2022-12-08. --- Simple Summary. This publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool. Abstract. There are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. To recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings. Aave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract. Motivation. Decide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRVs token price) Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV. There is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlets insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this: 1) Auction via the shortfall event. 2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV. Option 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt. There has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired. With the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave. If Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding. As part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets]([link]) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol. Holdings Summary. | Holding | $ Value | % of Excessive Debt | | --- | --- | --- | | aUSDC | 6,002,226.07| 340.56 | | USDC | 358,701.07 | 20.35 | | v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98 | 24.70 | | aCRV | 330,834.02 | 18.98 | | Excessive Debt | 1,762,478.27| 100 | The table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings. Due to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol. Specification. Deploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. The exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps. CRV/USD Oracle: '[hexadecimals]' Estimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 0.0010 = $1,762.48. A $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15. A cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. The actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively. To repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within. pool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address) CRV: 'ethereum:[hexadecimals]' Total Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV. Address: '[hexadecimals]' Next Steps. Discuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be: Option 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV. Option 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV. Option 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol. Option 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol. If the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap.

Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2022-11-11. --- Simple Summary. @llamaxyz proposed assigning the stMATIC and MaticX 'Emission_Admin' role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Polygon Foundation. Abstract. The Polygon Foundation team intends to distribute stMATIC and MaticX incentives to the wMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the 'EmissionManager' contract needs to assign an owner to the 'Emission_Admin' permission allowing stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed, [1,2] This can only be achieved via the governance process. This proposal assigns the 'Emission_Admin' permission to stMATIC and MaticX rewards to the following address '[hexadecimals]' Motivation. The motivation of the proposal is to enable stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the Lido community to distribute LDO rewards across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3] Specification. The Polygon Foundation team will determine the emission rate and duration at which stMATIC and MaticX rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAOs ability to adjust the wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the stMATIC / wMATIC and MaticX/wMATIC loop. The 'Emission_Admin' is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The 'EmissionManager' determines the stMATIC and MaticX 'Emission_Admin' and not the stMATIC or MaticX Reserve. The 'Emission_Admin' can distribute stMATIC and MaticX anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool. Implementation. Set 'Emission_Admin' permission for stMATIC 'matic:[hexadecimals]' and MaticX 'matic:[hexadecimals]' on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Polygon Foundations address: 'matic:[hexadecimals]', [4,5,6] References.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nIntroduction. Given most of this proposal is inevitably copy pasta'd quarter to quarter I'll highlight the key changes compared to Q4 to ensure nothing is missed. First, a group decision was made to add Tritium as the seventh Maxi. We have interfaced with him over the last few weeks and believe his skill set to be complementary to the responsibilities carried out by Maxis. One near term initiative for Tritium will be decentralizing Balancers snapshot operations and dissolving the Governance Council. A proposal will soon be presented for community feedback on this topic. Prior to joining the Maxis Tritium contributed at Badger and Aura. The second major change compared to Q4 is that Maxis took over the lead on Partnerships for the ecosystem so we've added a relevant section outlining our key objectives in this area. The north star success metric is increasing protocol revenue, with secondary goals being growing TVL dominance on L2s and increasing market share of DEX volume. If these numbers move in the right direction it will not solely be driven by Maxis but by every team across the entire ecosystem. In the case that we are not successful in seeing positive growth continue to develop during 23 the community would be justified in seeking alternative teams to lead Partnerships. Finally, we are increasing the monthly allocation of BAL for gas expenses as we expect to deploy many new boosted pools in January. We're also increasing the monthly BAL allocated to Coordinape from 4,000 to 5,000 given the decline of BAL price and the recent addition of new community contributors who are solely compensated from Coordinape. Service Provider Name: Balancer Maxis Leader(s): Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko. Please welcome the newest addition to the cast - Tritium! Pledge to abide by the DAOs [Code of Conduct]([link]) (or link to your own): Yes Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines]([link]): Yes Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics: As Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocols future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer. Our Q1 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q4 funding post]([link]) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level with some reflections on Q3 and the path ahead of us. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for [October]([link]), [November]([link]), and [December]([link]) Multisig Management Linear (boosted) pool settings Swap fee and amplification adjustments Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL Adding new reward tokens to gauges Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig. These are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist  they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people. Governance We serve on the [Governance Council]([link]) and ensure continuity of Balancers Governance Process Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics Several of us are [delegates]([link]) Advise projects on Balancers governance process Manage admin of the Governance Forum We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group. During Q4 Balancer governance processed many proposals as usual. The Maxis ensured that proposals were put up for a vote according to the schedule in BIP-9 and followed through on execution of each approved vote. We believe active governance is a good thing for Balancer  we will continue to make proposals, engage in constructive dialogue, and represent Balancers interests both on our home forum and elsewhere. Partnerships We manage Balancers Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions We often deploy new pools for other projects Whitelisting and maintaining token lists We help with UI testing for Balancer Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancers technology, primarily in the DeFi realm Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations. Maxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are significantly expanding boosted pool offerings, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc) We believe Balancer has made strong progress over the last few months as we pivoted into yield bearing liquidity (an initiative spearheaded by Maxis) and we look to build on this momentum into 23 and beyond. Community We manage a monthly Coordinape circle, open to all DAO contributors Onboarding framework for new contributors Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. By adopting an easy and seamless onboarding framework, every applicant is being reached through discovery calls and monthly follow-ups. We help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer. By keeping contributors engaged, we aim to retain talents in the Balancer ecosystem as Ballers, Grantees or shaping their own Service Provider. Record Keeping We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded. Length of Engagement & Budget: 3 months. Budget of 10,800 BAL per month for salaries (1,800 per person, Danko & Tritium at 900) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. This represents $10k/mo for each contributor (Danko/Tritium at half) at todays BAL price (~$5.5) Additional monthly allocations of 200 BAL for gas costs and 5,000 BAL for Coordinape. Total for 3 month engagement: 48,000 BAL Impact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~4.8M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q4 would cost around 1% of the treasurys BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~4% of the treasurys BAL.

References/Useful links: > Link to:  Website:[link]  Documentation: [link]  Github Page: [link]  Communities: [Twitter]([link]), [Discord]([link]), [Telegram]([link]) Protocol Description: >Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. >Tranchess' fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying assets price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation. >Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. Motivation: > The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience. >A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative. Specifications: 1. Governance: Tranchess' governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchesss snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum]([link]) 2. Oracles: Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle. 3. Audits: Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here]([link]) Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program]([link]) with Immunefi. 4. Centralization vectors: The token is not upgradeable or pausable. The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract. Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators. 5. Market History: Link to the pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Link to the gauge: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) 6. Value: The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nIntroduction. One of the biggest changes Balancer made to veCRV when we released veBAL was the use of BAL/WETH 80/20 BPT as the locking token instead of BAL. This has allowed BAL to have extremely deep on-chain liquidity relative to our circulating market cap, all without having to spend costly emissions on BAL liquidity incentives. Encouraging the adoption of similar ve8020 systems across DeFi is a key strategic objective for the ecosystem. This kind of locked liquidity is far more sticky than usual TVL earned from liquidity mining, plus Balancers emissions will not be the primary driving force behind users choosing to participate as the project itself will contribute their own emissions, revenue sharing, gauge voting, or similar mechanisms. While the benefits of adopting ve8020 are numerous it remains a relatively novel concept that most users are not familiar with. It will require additional dev work from projects looking to adopt this compared to single token locking. Thus I propose that the Balancer ecosystem starts a new program for incentivizing ve8020 adoption which will outline BAL grants for projects which meet certain TVL and revenue milestones. Each project must be approved by a Balancer governance vote to participate. Program Outline This program is intended to support all systems which involve the staking/locking of 8020 BPT. ve8020 is one such system and its a convenient shorthand to use, but this program is not limited to \"ve systems only. I suggest leaving the qualifications for participating as soft requirements since its difficult to account for every possible future situation. We must carefully balance spending BAL to drive ve8020 adoption in a bear market with vaporware projects adopting it just to get paid. Some factors Balancer governance should assess for projects adopting ve8020: Project track record - has it been around awhile, is it likely to exist going forward, does it have an active community/user base, etc. Circulating market cap and trading activity - is there a reasonable likelihood for this ve8020 to contribute significant protocol revenue for Balancer? BAL incentives should go to ve8020 lockers only, and the lock should have a minimum duration of 16 weeks. It will be up to each project to make the case to Balancer for why they should qualify. Balancer is looking for ve8020s that not only drive high TVL but also drive protocol revenue. All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL and ideally the project will provide the necessary 20% of ETH so that no BAL is sold. Proposed Milestones Upon a successful Balancer governance vote for a project to join this program they would immediately be eligible for a grant of 25k BAL. The intention is to make this program accessible to most projects with the goal of Balancer benefitting from their future growth since they're parking locked liquidity with us. The first two milestones accomplish this while the final two milestones serve to entice larger projects to adopt this standard. If all milestones are met a project stands to gain 250,000 BAL! Please note that only TVL and revenue from locked liquidity will be counted towards the milestones. In order to future proof this program against changes in market conditions the milestones are given in relation to the price of BAL. 25k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 25k BAL by 30x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds \u2153 the value of 25k BAL 50K BAL. TVL exceeds value of 50k BAL by 30x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 50k BAL 50k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 50k BAL by 100x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 50k BAL by 4x 100k BAL. TVL exceeds value of 100k BAL by 200x. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds the value of 100k BAL by 4x. Using todays price of $5.50 BAL, these milestones would be the following: 25k BAL. TVL exceeds $4.125M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $45.8k 50k BAL. TVL exceeds $8.25M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $275k 50k BAL. TVL exceeds $27.5M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $1.1M 100k BAL. TVL exceeds $110M. Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $2.2M. As a final note, I believe it is prudent to include that once a year passes from the approval of a projects vote to be included they must present another proposal to remain in the program for another year. Failure to do so would make them ineligible for any future milestone distributions. Specification. If approved, governance will soon see applications from projects interested in this program. No immediate action is required. The goal is to establish a clear, unbiased incentives program that is easy to understand and massively scale ve8020 adoption in 2023.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOEkwylipGD4GWjEjl08qy5Qekut", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954018, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests incentivizing the adoption of ve8020 systems across DeFi by offering grants of BAL tokens to projects that meet certain TVL (total value locked) and revenue milestones.

This proposal is created to further support the mission of a Multichain Uniswap. We propose to the Uniswap community to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet. Scroll is an EVM equivalent zk-Rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum. Similarly to Uniswap, Scroll started out working closely with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community, for the community! Deploying to Scroll bears many benefits, such as significant savings for users, user base growth, capturing the zkEVM market in advance, and fostering L2 native innovation. We are aligned with Ethereum in our community ethos and vision. We are committed to Ethereums decentralized, censorship-resistant and efficient future. Generally, we believe that Uniswaps community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized (financial) infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit and location. In the following we detail Scrolls architecture and mission. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the communitys questions. About Scroll. Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent ZK-rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security. We have been building in the open from day one, and collaborating on the zkEVM with the PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group at the Ethereum Foundation. Scroll is aiming at building the best possible solution to scale Ethereum Layer 1. Scroll is compatible with Ethereum at the bytecode level, which is a major breakthrough in Layer 2 technology and brings huge benefits to the entire Ethereum community: EVM equivalent: Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits. Developer friendly: Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously. Security: Scroll inherits all the features and security of EVM which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space. Decentralization: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is the only L2 that has committed to outsource proving before launching on mainnet. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem. Advance Ethereums ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereums ultimate goal of \"zkSNARK Everything. Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum! ZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling - a best-in-class Layer 2 scaling solution that is very cheap and secure. Scrolls vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to, thereby helping Ethereum scale without affecting the developer experience. We are live on testnet and will be launching on mainnet once our rapidly growing community of users, developers and auditors battle test the network. Proposal. By launching on testnet, Uniswap has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk-Rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols (dapps) who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with an AMM. This is an opportunity for Uniswap to be a strong consideration for these applications. Uniswaps multi-chain mission can be facilitated and accelerated by deploying on Scroll in the most seamless way currently possible on Ethereum. Uniswap is a uniquely important DEX in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that an L2 affords. Uniswap on Scroll will: Be able to offer high throughput, tps and low gas fees to cater to financial applications which are latency-sensitive such as Uniswap. Consolidate the projects position as an early mover and capture a rapidly growing market in advance as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to a zkEVM focus. Integrate closely with Scrolls rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to begin deployment within weeks of our initial testnet launch. Projects include Lens, theGraph, Covalent, Empiric, Blockwallet, Ledger, Safe, Orbiter and many more. Based on the excitement around Scroll and zkRollups broadly, we expect over a hundred projects to deploy on our permissionless testnet. Propel L2 DEX innovation. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now. Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available. Help foster an ecosystem fueled by creativity. Applications (Games, DeFi and more) that have not been seen till now will be deploying on Scroll and having Uniswap on Scroll is mutually beneficial as novel use-cases will use swaps and liquidity pools. Everything from in-game economies to zk-dapps with swap features will have the opportunity to integrate with Uniswap, leading to a new era for application-layer innovation. Bridge Security. ZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics. Currently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges. Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase. Last but not least, Scroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Its code security is closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation and Filecoin. We firmly believe that using such community standards is the most solid way to maintain the security of the codebase and the security of the entire system. Timeline. After passing the Temperature Check we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll testnet. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks. It is important to us to be closely in touch with the Uniswap community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOEkXcf9ePe45nAYK26fMXka3BSm", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954018, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that Uniswap V3 should be deployed on the Scroll testnet, which is a zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.

Author: @Llamaxyz, Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, 3SE Holdings & @ItsFreeRealEstate. Status: Proposed. Dated: 2022.11.26. --- Simple Summary. As part of the Sunsetting of v1, the v2 -> v3 Migration & the Deprecation of v2 discussions being conducted by the community [here]([link]) and [here]([link]), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets: - Aave v1 \\(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\\) - Aave v2 \\(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\\) Abstract. With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments. Note: The Aave ARC & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the \"Permissioned\" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the \"Permissioned\" code base. Motivation. This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments. Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. Specification. The Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools<!--deployments-->, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses. - Ethereum V1 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V1 Uniswap Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Ethereum V2 AMM Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Polygon V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) - Avalanche V2 Market [[hexadecimals]]([link]) References: [Aave v1 Docs]([link]), [Aave v2 Docs]([link]) This represents the first progression toward deprecating the v1 & v2 deployments across all networks.

The gauge for the OHM-DAI-ETH pool should also be disabled as the Olympus Treasury is expecting to migrate fully out of it in the coming days. Specifications: 1. OlympusDAO is currently using snapshot for Governance: [Snapshot]([link]) Treasury [multisig]([link]) 4 of 8: Holds Olympus Treasury assets. DAO [multisig]([link]) 4 of 8: Holds DAO funds.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nTL;DR Residual Token, Inc. proposes to build, launch and maintain BalancerP2PTM, a savings, lending and borrowing tool that will integrate into the existing BalancerTM ecosystem. Residual Token, Inc. will not charge Balancer development or maintenance fees, and Balancer will not incur any out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees. Residual Token, Inc. requests that Balancer - at its own expense - adds hyperlinks to its website that point to BalancerP2P, and advertises BalancerP2P to its users. Liquidations, a common function required to keep a P2P platform healthy, are managed by outside bots with no economic benefit to Residual Token nor Balancer. Summary. Residual Token, Inc. (dba unFederalReserve) proposes to offer Balancer a license to BalancerP2P, a front-end interface to the ReserveLending Core. The ReserveLending Core (hereafter, the 'Core') is an overcollateralized Pool-to-Peer1 lending protocol that brings together savers, lenders and borrowers from a variety of cryptocurrency ecosystems, platforms and brands. This global connectivity is facilitated by the use of multiple front-ends that each provide access to the Cores single set of liquidity pools. The Licensor, Residual Token, Inc. (hereafter, Residual'), will build and maintain the BalancerP2P front-end, and will not charge the Licensee, Balancer, development or maintenance fees (development is estimated to cost around $50,000 of Residuals own capital, and maintenance is approximately $3,000/mos) Balancer will not incur any out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees for hosting BalancerP2P. Balancers treasury will earn 10% of the reserves generated from borrowers connecting through BalancerP2P. In other words, it will earn a portion of the APY that BalancerP2P borrowers pay on loans, and in the case of loan defaults, it will earn a portion of the recovered collateral. Additionally, revenues from existing Balancer trading tools are projected to increase due to higher trading volume. Residual projects a 30-40% increase in Balancers trading volume as users take advantage of interest paying deposit accounts and affordable loans available through BalancerP2P. Detailed projections are available in the Forecast section below. Note, the extent of work requested to be undertaken by Balancer - at its own expense - will be: Adding hyperlinks to the Balancer website that point to BalancerP2P. Advertising BalancerP2P to both existing and future Balancer users. At the user level, BalancerP2P will: Empower Metamask, Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet users to earn APY - without relinquishing custody of their cryptocurrency to a third-party - via BalancerP2Ps Supply or Deposit function; Allow users to borrow a select set of cryptocurrency types on an overcollateralized basis at reasonable APYs; and Provide users the ability to leverage up, short sell certain assets, or increase purchasing power using safe, reliable and easy-to-use features. Balancers users will also have the added bonus of combining the above benefits with the robust trading tools already offered by Balancer, thus spending more time in the Balancer ecosystem, and increasing overall engagement with the Balancer product suite. The BalancerP2P user interface will be custom designed to fit Balancers existing brand style. Below are sample images of Residuals own front-end, ReserveLendingTM. The BalancerP2P front-end will share a similar overall layout, along with custom Balancer theming across multiple webpages.

These experts will provide knowledge to the Balancer community on strategies to employ depending on Balancers users' wishes and market conditions. For. Onboard Balancer as a Licensee to BalancerP2P, a front-end of the ReserveLending Core. Residual will build the customized front-end for Balancer at no cost to Balancer. BalancerP2P will provide Balancer users access to the ReserveLending Core in an experience simpatico with the Balancer platform today, and will earn Balancer 10% of reserves generated through BalancerP2P. Balancer - at its own expense - will add hyperlinks to its website that point to BalancerP2P, and will advertise BalancerP2P to its users. Against. Do not onboard Balancer as a Licensee to BalancerP2P. Context. In business since 2017, Residual Token, Inc. is a Fintech SaaS company specializing in banking, Web3 and DeFi software development. Licensing software is Residuals primary source of revenue, and a live utility token, eRSDL, is used as part of its Licensing-as-a-Service (LaaS) model, which is explained in detail here: [link] The ReserveLending Core is a retail DeFi protocol for overcollateralized Pool-to-Peer1 lending and borrowing that is owned by Residual. The Core is based on the Compound Protocol, which is non-custodial, meaning that Residual does not have control over supplied assets, and users are not exposed to the typical risks inherent in centralized custodial lending. The Core is also permissionless, meaning that any address is free to access the Cores liquidity pools. A review of the Cores activity can be found here: [link] Front-ends (interfaces) to the Core allow users to supply assets to earn APY, and optionally use their supplied assets as collateral to borrow on margin. Users across all Core front-ends share access to the same Core liquidity pools. This means that a user accessing the Core from one front-end can supply assets to a liquidity pool; while a user accessing the Core from another front-end can borrow those assets from the same liquidity pool (assuming the borrower has supplied enough collateral to satisfy this key condition to the loan) Residual hosts a front-end to the Core, branded ReserveLending. Residual also offers front-end licenses to third parties (Licensees) Front-ends are custom-themed for Licensees, allowing for seamless integration with existing branded ecosystems. Residual will build and maintain a customized front-end for Licensees, and will not charge Licensees development or maintenance fees. Furthermore, Licensees will not incur any out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees for hosting a front-end. The extent of work required to be undertaken by a Licensee - at its own expense - will be: Adding hyperlinks to its website that point to the front-end. Advertising the front-end to both existing and future users. Allocation of Reserves. The reserves accumulated by the Core are allocated to: 1. Rewards paid to Licensees. 2. License fees collected by Residual Token, Inc. (aka unFederalReserve) Rewards paid to Licensees. The total allocation of Licensee rewards is divided amongst Licensees in amounts reflecting the percentage of the total TVL that is borrowed from the Core through each Licensees front-end. Residual tracks and reports on these amounts using URL-related analytics and activity mapping. In this case, Residual will track Core activity tied to the BalancerP2P front-end - using its URL - when estimating the licensing fee. Please refer to the Forecast section for detailed reward projections. License fees collected by Residual Token, Inc. (aka unFederalReserve) Given that Licensees do not pay any out-of-pocket licensing fees, Residual collects licensing fees from the Core reserves. In line with the Licensing-as-a-Service (LaaS) model, part of the licensing fees will be directed to reimburse Residual for its costs and profit expectations, and part will be used to conduct open market purchases of eRSDL tokens (eRSDL tokens are digital markers representing license state, and are burned as licenses are consumed) Licensee benefits of hosting a Core front-end: Rewards. Licensees are rewarded part of the Core reserves. A Licensees rewards reflect the TVL that is borrowed from the Core through its front-end. The greater the amount borrowed, the greater the rewards. No out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees. Residual will not charge development or maintenance fees. Expansion of product offerings to both existing and potential users. Removal of the need to build, test, maintain and audit a similar platform in-house. The Core has undergone extensive security tests and audits; most notably Trail of Bits successfully completed an audit just a few months ago. In-house Core access means that a Licensees users no longer have to visit potentially risky third-party lending services.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSimple Summary Mimic is a platform for DeFi automation. By deploying custom Smart Vaults, it can transform centralized manual work into trustless automated actions. Recently, members of the ParaSwap DAO have proposed to implement a Fee Redistribution mechanism as part of their [PSP 2.0 proposal]([link]), in which assets accrued as fees would be converted to a native chain token (eg. ETH), and then distributed between stakers and the DAO treasury. In the current version of the proposal, there is no automated solution for this mechanism. We propose that Mimic Smart Vaults could be used to automatically convert accrued assets into the desired token. Mimic Smart Vault could be deployed in each different layer ParaSwap is in to automate how ParaSwap collects, converts and distributes its protocol fees. Context: About Mimic Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative Smart Vaults concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs. Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults. ![mimic_paraswap]([link]) Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked on many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP, and The Graph. Goals Currently, ParaSwap DAO collects protocol fees in seven layers: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum and Optimism. Assuming that the ParaSwap DAO decides to implement the fee redistribution system proposed in PSP 2.0, We propose to provide ParaSwap DAO with a solution to automate how it collects and distributes its protocol fees to assist with the implementation of this system. To accomplish this, Mimic will deploy customized Smart Vaults owned by ParaSwap DAO, one on each layer. All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when each token reaches a pre-determined value in USDC. Collected PSP and wrapped native chain token will not be converted. Collected chain token will be wrapped All other tokens will be converted to wrapped native chain token. Finally, once a month, those collected tokens will be automatically withdrawn from Mainnet Smart Vault to a ParaSwap smart contract to distribute back to their token holders. Also, it is essential to mention that at all times, the DAO has full ownership and control of all Smart Vaults assets. This means that, for example, at any moment, it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself. Means There will be seven Smart Vaults - one per layer: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions. Some of which will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that ParaSwap DAO designates. Those actions are: - Gather and swap: Gathers assets (except from WETH and ETH) from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and swaps them to WETH (except from PSP) - Gather and wrap: Gathers WETH or ETH from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and if ETH, wraps it into WETH. - Withdraw monthly: Withdraws WETH to a ParaSwap smart contract. - Withdraw: Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner. Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code. Actions won't be allowed to perform any other logic (More information here: [[link]]([link])) In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowments objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. Following the current implementation of PSP 2.0, all smart vaults could initially gather and swap into WETH, and the assets could be bridged to Mainnet for redistribution. If the DAO proposes to implement staking on any of these chains in the future, the parameters of these vaults could also be changed if needed. Metrics: Operational Details 1. Reporting Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 2. Maintenance Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults daily, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will use its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. If a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, the Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes. 3. Fees Mimic will charge a 2% fee for the assets processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD monthly cap. Fees will start at 0% and increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% after a year of execution. 3. a. Test Period The first six epochs of the Mimic implementation will be considered a pilot period to assess the effectiveness of the solutions implemented. After that, fees will increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% (always with a monthly cap) 4. Termination As mentioned before, ParaSwap DAO will fully control its Smart Vaults and the funds deposited into them. This means ParaSwap DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the ParaSwap DAO, will never be in control of those funds. 4. Audit Initially, Mimic Smart Contracts have been all privately audited. They were recently audited by Verilog and no critical issues were found. Currently, they are being audited by Certora. More information and full reports here: [[link]]([link]) Implementation Overview Once the final details of the ParaSwap Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility for setting up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case. Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by ParaSwap DAO, setting seven Smart Vaults for it shouldn't take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process just for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn't take more than one week.

A proposal to adjust 2 total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for USDC on Aave V2 Ethereum. Abstract. Following recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121]([link]), [AIP-124]([link]), and [AIP-125]([link])) After mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of USDC. Reducing capital efficiency on v2 assets will mitigate attack vectors while also serving as effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies. As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to make the full implications clear to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the Risk-Off Framework 2 previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat 1) Motivation. The priority of this proposal is not to optimize markets (capital efficiency); but rather to focus on the security and risk mitigation of the protocol. It will be followed up with additional proposals to update risk parameters to reflect the current market conditions accurately. The goal of this ARC is two-fold: Reduce LTs  Reducing liquidation thresholds for USDC effectively reduces capital efficiency and increases the required capital for waging price manipulation attacks on Aave. Encourage user migrations to v3  This also begins to pave the way towards migrating to v3, where these assets can be utilized in E-mode. However, this is a significant change, and we wanted to present data to quantify and visualize the effect of such reductions on protocol users for community discussion. Specifically, we want to surface data around the liquidations this would trigger, as some are sizable and warrant a discussion of how these should be handled and if this is the most appropriate action forward. USDC LT Reduction Implications: Mainnet snapshot captured on December 6th, 20:00 GMT. ![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 5.43.49 [image]]([link]) Summary. Based on prior community discourse and market activity over the past few weeks, Aave should continue reviewing avenues to derisk all v2 markets with a specific eye on LTs & LTVs. Forced liquidations of user accounts are a major factor in deciding how and when to reduce these parameters to minimize negative user experience. _Chaos Labs recommends reducing USDC LT by 150 bps (Option 1)_\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nBackground. Stargates token, STG, is traded both on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs) STG is listed on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin among others. Proposal. Market makers provide a key service within centralized exchanges, by offering deep liquidity on both sides of a market (on both the bid and ask side) This results in deep liquidity being available on both sides of the book allowing market participants to interact with the token freely (buy and sell amounts without moving the price dramatically) Without a market maker a exchanges orderbook tends to become illiquid, which could in turn lead to a poor user experience when interacting with the asset on that exchange. This can lead to an exchange deprioritizing or delisting that asset. Many of the largest centralized exchanges actually encourage an active market maker as a point of reference. Market makers typically adhere to certain service level agreements (SLAs) covering a range of obligations such as spread, quote depth, uptime and other metrics to continually ensure a smooth functioning market. In exchange for these services, market makers are usually either paid a fee for services rendered or compensated by a structured 'call' option that keeps them aligned with the asset they're market making for. An example of an agreement is that the market maker may ensure $X depth within Y percent slippage for the asset and ensure they are available and servicing the market at least 99% of the time. After a fixed term they then will either return the asset borrowed for market making or a cash equivalent at a predetermined strike price. Market makers typically require a loan of assets. Assets being loaned are important to a market maker because it allows them to service both sides of the market. An active market maker needs to be able to both buy an asset around its current price but also sell an asset around that same price to ensure market participants have enough liquidity to suit their desires around accumulating or divesting an asset. Numerous market makers have submitted proposals with loan requests ranging from 5,000,000 to 50,000,000 tokens and varying strike prices, some of which were below the actual current spot price. A competitive offer from a high reputable firm is key to successful market making in this environment. Combining a reputable custodian of the loan who has a track record of safeguarding client funds with a smaller loan size and a strike price that is significantly higher than the current market price ensures the party selected is vetted and aligned towards the long term success of Stargate. Execution. STG would be made available to a suitable and qualified market maker for STG under terms that do not exceed a loan of 8,000,000 STG for a 24 month period. The up to 8,000,000 STG are loaned to a market maker who will then use them to support free flowing liquidity of STG across multiple venues. The market maker will take no fees for this service but will be given an option to buy the STG after the term expires at predetermined prices. This helps align their upside for services rendered with Stargates. They will help support a free flowing and robust market and any upside of token appreciation during that tenure is their reward for doing so. After the term, STG would be returned to The Foundation or an equivalent amount of USDC at a price of $0.80 or above per STG. The exact amount per STG will be equal to or higher than $0.80 but a floor is set to provide confidence in the number while also not revealing any data that would compromise market integrity. Success. If successful, A qualified market maker will be chosen with a strike price on the option granted of at least $0.80 (with goals of significantly higher) after a 24 month term. This will enable liquidity to be deeper across all centralized exchanges allowing for market participants to buy and/or sell STG more easily. Summary. The Stargate DAO shall loan up to 8,000,000 STG for a term of not more than 24 months to a qualified market maker to maintain liquidity for STG token. This will create more robust centralized exchange liquidity and allow for a better functioning STG market both on and off chain. Stargate Foundation shall secure the aforementioned requirements on behalf of Stargate DAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nKeywords. PSP LIquidity, Grants. Simple Summary. With PSP 2.0 now successfully designed and agreed on by the ParaSwap DAO, we now can focus on the deployment of PSP to Optimism following the Phase I grant by the Optimism Collective. The following proposal seeks to introduce PSP to Optimism, as well as the Gas Refund Program that comes with it. Following that, this proposal will provide PSP to match the liquidity needed for the PSP-OP pool, as well as matching the OP grants with PSP as needed. Finally, with the deployment of PSP 2.0, this proposal also urges the prioritization of the Optimism network for Social Escrow PSP in the future, as thanks to the Protocol Owned Liquidity grant, it will be possible to have enough initial liquidity to bootstrap a healthy staking ecosystem. In addition to the aforementioned points, an addendum has been added to self-nominate ParaSwap as one of the Protocol Delegates for Optimism Governance. Context. As part of the Phase 1 grants, the [Optimism Collective]([link])approved an initial grant for the ParaSwap DAO. For those that missed the proposal, it can be summarised in three categories: 225,000 OP: Introduction of a dApp developer grant for Optimism 157,500 OP: Establishment of OP-PSP, a protocol-owned liquidity pool 67,500 OP: Encouragement of DexLib integrations through ParaSwap with special grants. While this grant was being voted on in the Optimism Token House, the ParaSwap DAO was discussing some major reforms to the PSP tokenomics system in the form of PSP 2.0. Now that there are clear plans for what the reforms entail, we can align the funds given during Phase I to bootstrap the launch of Social Escrow while we go through the process of receiving the OP grants. Goals. To be able to provide the $PSP needed for the matching, this proposal first suggests porting the PSP token to Optimism, as well as implementing the Gas Refund Program onto Optimism. After PSP is deployed to this Optimistic Rollup, we will provide the necessary PSP to maximise the Phase I Optimism Funds and Protocol-Owned Liquidity, as well as prepare Optimism for a successful deployment of Social Escrowed PSP on that chain in the future. Means. There are various aspects that have to be considered about how to best use the OP grants given. Below, we explore a few aspects that have to be considered, and how this proposal seeks to address them: Selecting a Source of liquidity. Of the OP requested, approximately 157,500 OP are devoted to providing a permanent source of liquidity for a PSP-OP. This allows for a solution that is more sustainable in the long run compared to other liquidity providing methods like liquidity mining. However, what kind of liquidity pool will be the best long-term option for this OP-PSP pool? Personally, the only requirement we should consider is to not go with a simple 50/50 asset pool. As we are dealing with two assets that are not correlated with one another, any form of decoupling on either side will result in a large amount of Impermanent Loss on the assets. Due to this, the current proposed LP will be in Beethoven X, with its Balancer-style skewed pools. Of all the possible ratios, a pool where 80% of the assets is PSP is the best option for this grant if we choose to minimize impermanent loss. By adding more OP to the pool, we would: Minimize the risk of impermanent loss, maximizing asset efficiency This pool might become a boosted asset in Beethoven X in the future, allowing for the earning of yield of these assets long-term were this to happen. Another potential option is to deploy a Uni V3 pool, however, that would require creating a special strategy from scratch, and depending on flexibility of this strategy it might require more micromanagement. However, if anyone has an idea for this (or even other DEXes), feel free to bring it up! Grant Selection Process. The main purpose of the grants provided are to allow growth of the Optimism ecosystem while also encouraging the use of ParaSwap to encourage dApp developers to best access all DeFi services. For that reason, it is important to determine that the grants are used correctly. Heres a rough idea of potential categories that we could use to determine the degree of PSP matching: 1. Optimism deployment for existing dApps - Encouraging onboarding to the Optimism ecosystem - Matching of PSP of up to 10 PSP/OP. 2. Novel applications of ParaSwap - New uses of ParaSwap (even on apps that are using ParaSwap for something else already) Matching of up to 15 PSP/OP. 3. Social Escrow Research - Uses that are directly related to improving the experience in Optimism of either the ParaSwap protocol or the DAO. Some examples could be an alternative frontend or a clever use of the ParaSwap API. Matching of up to 20 PSP/OP. 4. DexLib Grant: The grantee wishes to integrate a DEX on Optimism, and is not directed affiliated with either ParaSwap or the relevant DEX. This grantaims to incentivise developers to assist integrations of protocols they love. To apply for a grant, the best possible solution is to have grantees apply through the governance forum, explaining the amount of OP that they wish to use and more details about the project. The following template could be used for grant applications: Project Name Relevant Protocol Metrics Grant Category Optimism Alignment ParaSwap Alignment Amount of OP + PSP requested Success Metrics. Since the PSP needed for these grants would already be approved with this vote, the proposed quorum for these grants can be removed, though a reduced quorum is also possible if the community believes is more appropriate. Metrics and Forward Thinking Considerations. While PSP liquidity is something difficult to measure, we can measure the effectiveness of the grants given by the quality and amount of projects benefiting from these grants. If any of these grants end up being underutilized, a future proposal could be made to the collective to re-allocate these funds. In the future, if we ever consider making PSP multichain, we can consider Optimism one of our first places to deploy to if liquidity is deployed successfully. Addendum: Protocol Self-Nomination Approval. Following the introduction of [Protocol Delegates]([link]) to the Optimism Governance forums, we additionally propose that the ParaSwap DAO should self-nominate as a delegate for Optimism governance. Due to the conflicting deadlines between this proposal and the applications, we propose that for now , the redactor of this proposal (Oxytocin) nominates for the position, but in a future vote we can add additional ParaSwap representatives onto our seat in the nomination table. Once again due to timing issues, this approval will have to be retroactive, but will still depend on the passing of this vote. Implementation Overview. 1. Introduce the PSP token to Optimism. 2. Implement the Gas Refund Program Onto Optimism. 3. Establish the grants system. 4. Introduce the OP/PSP PoL , providing enough PSP to match an OP/PSP pool with 20/80 allocation. 5. Nominate a DAO member as a Protocol Delegate in Optimism Governance.

The bear market and recent market events has shown the importance of increasing the adoption of defi and more decentralized infrastructure. With increased centralized competition, speed of execution is of the utmost importance for the whole industry. To date, Lido DAOs referral program has exceeded expectations. However, the current model is unsustainable. With protocol sustainability in mind, referral rewards need to be reduced to a manageable level. A longer-term revenue share model is outside the scope of this proposal. The initial focus will be on Ethereum. Proposal. We are submitting the following proposal: 1. Implement a new referral model for stETH structured as per referrer: - 2.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $100m worth of ETH. - 3.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $250m worth of ETH. - 4.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $500m worth of ETH. - 5.0 DAI per ETH referred up to $1.0bn worth of ETH. - 5.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $5.0bn worth of ETH. 2. The new model starts at 0 and is cumulative during the term of the program for participants. 3. Limit the initial reward pool to a maximum of 1,000,000 DAI. Depending on success and market dynamics, refreshing the pool in 1M DAI. increments will be voted on and discussed. Updates will be provided in. this thread. 4. Begin winding down the program before withdrawal operations are enabled on Ethereum. 1. Optional transition to successor program after withdrawals are enabled. Operations. Operations will be handled by the same [Referral Program committee & miltisig]([link]) through Aragon votes and Easy Track payment processing akin to the updated reWARDS setup with limits, paying in DAI. The new model, if approved, would: - Supersede and formally replace the [current referral program on Ethereum]([link]), effective immediately after the conclusion of a successful snapshot and vote. All. referrals in the legacy setup will be honored for final distribution. Including an update the terms and conditions of the program. - Change payout timings. Payouts are to be calculated every calendar month with a twap of 30 days for ETH/DAI. This is to create stability in the pricing mechanism in case of volatility in the market. If there is detected manipulation of DAI pricing, USDT and USDC may be used as backup. - Implement an exit clause or emergency trigger. In the event of manipulation or overwhelming success, there will be certain limits placed on the payouts of the program in order to protect Lido DAO. This is a non-exhaustive list: - Lido DAO will not suffocate itself financially in facing overwhelming success of the program. - No cycle staking. Old or new, just don't do it. - Manipulating the exchange rate of stETH or DAI. - Yet to be identified attempts to game or manipulate the program which will be documented on the public site linked above. This proposal, if approved, would not: - Define the programs for other Lido on other chains. - Change the current payout process. - Define or scope the successor program. Conditions 1. Only allowed referral addresses will be eligible for rewards. 2. Users are given the ability to generate a unique referral URL that is specific to their Ethereum address. 3. Rewards are calculated once per month using a 30 day TWAP of ETH/DAI. 4. To be eligible for rewards in the current rewards calculation period, referral should drive at least 5 ETH in referee stakes during the period' 5. Referral rewards will paid out after review to spot any wrong doing or manipulation listed in terms and conditions. 6. A referral receives payout based on the proposed model (final conditions will list this explicitly on the Lido DAO site) 7. The Lido DAO referral program does not have any fixed time frame. The program ends when there are no more tokens in the reward pool (i.e., the total amount of DAI tokens that can be distributed to participants of the program) or when the DAO makes an active decision to cancel it. 8. The Lido DAO can stop, pause, and resume the program at any time. 9. The Lido DAO determines the size of the reward pool, amount and terms of the DAI reward, and can change them at any time. 10. The Lido DAO can at any time change the operating conditions of the Lido DAO referral program. Vote Outcomes. YAY: Approve new program terms and initial fund of 1,000,000 DAI.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet. Proposal. Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top notch scalability; built-in on-chain reputation through the Matrix Reputation Power System, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum. The Metis Layer 2 utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereums underlying security. As of right now, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitaliks proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a, first of its kind, Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollups security with plasmas scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next 2 verticals. Our second vertical is the Matrix Reputation Power System, a web3 identity system providing a framework to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain reputation: portable and composable reputation earned through on-chain achievements and history. As we all know, in traditional settings and Web2, our data is not ours; Matrix changes this. Soulbound tokens will also allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren't previously available for Web3. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 companies looking to transition to Web3 without facing a huge UI change. Third, our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework, for seamless onboarding of Web2 onto Web3. DAOs have been crucial for our space, but they lack a clear structure and the right tools to make them suitable for Web2 organizations. DACs, on the other hand, will allow Web2 organizations to tailor these to their preference. By combining DACs and our Polis Middleware, Web2 organizations will have access to a repertoire of smart contract templates, allowing them to deploy without the need of code: seamless, tailored Web2 experiences. When combining all these components, we will allow dApps, Web2 apps and organizations, and/or TradFi to enjoy a seamless onboarding experience and manage their day to day operations in a decentralized and immutable way, while taking advantage of the functionalities provided by on-chain reputation, and the scalability provided by the base Layer 2. The perfect suite for dApps, web2 platforms, or any builder. Committed to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can support projects in 3 main ways: -Builder Mining Rewards (Secured) -Ecosystem Grants (Application/Approval based) -Genesi DAC Investments (Application/Approval based) The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices) As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting Decentralized Finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets to support the Web3 economy we are building towards. We believe that with Metis-Aave integration, these foundations can be built in a decentralized and scalable way, secured by Ethereum, and welcoming for Web2. Through this integration, AAVE can also generate an extra revenue stream while ramping up its expansion to up and coming Ethereum Layer 2s. Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future in Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a surging DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aaves multichain expansion. There are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from, including Builder Mining Rewards, EVM Equivalence, our Smart L2 architecture, and a healthy mix of native and multichain protocols like LayerZero, Hummus, MaiFinance, Hermes, and much more. Metis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity, while securing the Andromeda and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network. Metis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\n> SUMMARY: This proposal is to add a new veBAL gauge for the TEMPLE/bb-a-USD 50/50 weighted pool and deprecate the current TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 weighted pool on Ethereum. References/Useful links: Website: templedao.link. Github Page: github.com/TempleDAO/TempleDAO. Communities: discord.gg/templedao / Twitter: @templedao. > PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION: TEMPLE is a low-volatility token with a focus on price stability and Treasury farming to increase stable backing per token. Our protocol is one of the largest liquidity providers in the Balancer Boosted Aave USD pool with $25-$40M in TVL over the past 30 days. Recently we launched the Temple Ascend Festival, which utilized Balancer v2 LBP technology to implement a token buyback program to return value to holders. The event was a success and resulted in over 51mm TEMPLE tokens purchased and generated high transaction volume for our TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 weighted pool by the utilization of Balancer routing from arbitrage bots. > MOTIVATION: This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the new TEMPLE/bb-a-USD 50/50 weighted pool. Initially, TempleDAO had seeded a weighted LP pool TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 chosen for its high farming efficiency and low risk of impermanent loss. It was also convenient to seed our LBP pools with DAI as opposed to FRAX so we could get correct pricing. To closer align our Protocol with the new BAL gauge framework introduced in BIP-57, we would like to switch our primary LP pool to Balancers preferred stablecoin bb-a-USD to pair against TEMPLE in a 50/50 pool to facilitate deep liquidity and seamless routing. Platform BAL incentives would incentivize TEMPLE liquidity as weekly trading transaction volume on the Temple custom Uni v2 AMM has ranged between $3M to $7M for the past 30 days. The TEMPLE-FRAX gauge on Frax Finance currently has over $20M in total value locked (TVL) and we have provided close to $1M USD value in FRAX and FXS in bribe incentives to drive liquidity into our FRAX gauge. Similarly our existing 80/20 TEMPLE/DAI LP which has $9.6M in TVL has generated between 1.3 - 2.0% in fees APY for the past 60 days. We have also provided over $300K of incentives to veBAL and vlAURA holders for the TEMPLE/DAI gauge on the Hidden Hand platform. Should this BIP proposal be approved, these incentive programs will be continued on the new Temple gauge. A new bb-a-USD trading pair would bring significant TEMPLE trading volume to the Balancer platform and indirectly drive more liquidity to bb-a-USD through our incentives program. TempleDAO plans to be active participants in Balancer governance as not only are we big fans of the technology, but also share a common vision of reducing price volatility, deep liquidity, and customizable asset exposure. A bb-a-USD pool would also make it easier to buy TEMPLE tokens with other stablecoins besides FRAX. > GOVERNANCE: TempleDAO current team has been almost entirely sourced from the community contributors. We started with a top-down nomination system for promotion and are currently in the early stages of implementing a Discord-integrated election system for promoting and demoting team members which will eventually lead to more decentralization. > ORACLES: TempleDAO does not rely on any external oracles. The intrinsic value backing per token used for price floor defense is coded into the contract: [hexadecimals] Our custom Uni v2 AMM has handled over $300M in transaction volume since launch without any issues. > AUDITS: TempleDAO contracts have been fully audited by Peckshield. We also have a generous and on-going bug bounty system at hats.finance funded with $400K USD in $TEMPLE rewards. > CENTRALIZATION VECTORS: The token is not upgradeable nor pausable; The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract; The team behind the token have shown that they have never abused nor committed any actions that would affect the integrity of the builders behind TempleDAO. > MARKET HISTORY: TEMPLE initiated its token presale in October of 2021 and public trading began on its own custom AMM on December 19, 2021. It currently has strategic partnerships with major protocols like Convex, Yearn, Aura, Frax, and Balancer. > VALUE STATEMENT AND CONCLUSION: The TempleDAO Team has been a major adopter of Balancer technology. Our protocol has generated significant volume on the Balancer platform through our LBP buyback program which is an integral part of our Protocol mechanics. TempleDAO has also been a significant bribe provider for veBAL holders by incentivizing emissions through Redacted Cartels Hidden Hand platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Should the 50/50 TEMPLE/bb-a-USD pool become whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would continue to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer, and in particular bb-a-USD liquidity paired against TEMPLE. TEMPLE/bb-a-USD 50/50 Weighted Pool Contract Address: > [hexadecimals] Gauge with 10% emissions cap: '[hexadecimals]' Zapper bundle for TempleDAO Treasury: [link] Additional Specification. Included in this proposal is the removal of the TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 gauge. If approved, the DAO Multisig '[hexadecimals]' will interact with the 'AuthorizerAdaptor' at '[hexadecimals]' and call 'performAction' using '[hexadecimals]' for the 'data(bytes)' argument and '[hexadecimals]' for the 'target(address)' argument. '[hexadecimals]' corresponds to the gauge contract for TEMPLE/DAI.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nKeywords. PSP 2.0, Gas Refund, PSP-EP. Simple Summary and Goals. As we get closer to the release of PSP 2.0, there are a few adjustments that have to be discussed before we can fully implement the new system. This express proposal seeks to address the issues relating to two aspects of the implementation: Gas Refund Program adjustment and the release epoch. To address these issues, we propose the following: Introduce a new formula for the new ParaBoost-reliant Gas Refund calculation. This is set to fix the continuous gas refund formula to make it more compatible with the current refund levels. The new formula is as follows: 0.152003ln(0.000517947x), where x corresponds to the ParaBoost score. The effective range of the formula will be from the minimum refund level of 25% to the maximum of 95% Approve the early conclusion of an epoch if PSP 2.0 is ready to release during an epoch, and distribute pro-rated rewards relative to the time elapsed during the epoch if needed. Context I - Gas Refund Level Adjustments. Following the suggestion of [another DAO member]([link]), one of the decisions of PSP 2.0 has been to make the gas refund levels continuous rather than the current discrete reward level system. This way, if you were, for example, between refund levels 1 and 2, you would receive a value between those as opposed to simply level 1. To do this, we used the following formula to get close to the levels stipulated in the refund table: ABS(0.126506 LN(0.335487 [Total PSP Stake Value]+ 1.64295)- 0.789135) |ParaBoost Score|Approximate Refund| | --- | --- | |10 000|24% (Min Refund Value)| |100 000|52%| |500 000|73%| |1 000 000|82%| |3 000 000|95% (Max Refund Value)| Figure 1: Approximate gas refund levels for the currently voted on formula for the new Socially Escrowed PSP system. While the current formula has close values for the first three levels (10k ParaBoost gives a 23.8% refund, 100k gives 53%, 500k gives 73.3%) the final level requires a significantly higher amount of more than 2.5 million PSP. This makes the formula unsuited for higher refund levels. Instead of staying with the current formula, we propose to introduce the following similar one: 0.152003 ln(0.000517947x) With this new formula, the refund values will be the following on the four desired levels: |ParaBoost Score|Approximate Refund| | --- | --- | |10 000|25% (Min Refund Value)| |100 000|60%| |500 000|85%| |1 000 000|95% (max refund value)| Figure 2: Approximate gas refund levels using the new formula. Finally, to make sure the formula works as specified within the range of the previous proposal, we are setting an effective range from 25 to 95% refund levels. Context II - Mid-Epoch release. With the release of PSP 2.0 fast approaching, we must also begin thinking about the possibility of releasing the new system during an existing epoch. While the ideal solution is to release it at the start of a new epoch if this target is not possible, there could be delays of up to two weeks as we wait for the epoch to be over before implementing PSP 2.0. To avoid this situation from happening, we propose the possibility of ending an epoch early with a notice period of 3 days for an early termination, and distributing the smoother rewards proportionally to the amount of time elapsed during the epoch if needed. Means and Implementation Overview Introduce a new adjusted formula to better fit the current values Shorten epoch length for PSP 2.0 release if needed Distribute pro-rated rewards.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nPost: [link] ~~~ On November 21st, we posted a Request for Comment 5 on a series of proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process. Thank you to everyone who has provided their comments! Based on community feedback and discussion, we are making some adjustments to our proposal. We will keep this proposal outstanding until next Wednesday December 14th, at which point we will post a Snapshot poll on the changes. The changes to the RFC based on feedback are as follows: Revisions and updates to RFC. Increase the new \"Request for Comment process to be a minimum of 7 days rather than our originally proposed 3 days. We agree with Alana Levin 2, GFX Labs 1, and others that a minimum of 1 week ensures that the community will have adequate time to digest each proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback. Increase the quorum for the new Temperature Check, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to 10M UNI rather than the originally proposed 5M UNI. As pointed out by Deven Matthews 1 from Blockchain at Berkeley, 37 delegates meet the 2.5mm threshold  proposers would only need to garner support from 2 of these delegates to move to the last governance vote with a 5M quorum. Increasing quorum to 10M UNI increases the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support. We highlight two suggestion from Toby from Other Internet to 1) standardize Snapshot language, particularly by formalizing the use of \"No change rather than other more biased language in Snapshot polls, and 2) reach out to popular governance platforms where the governance process is listed to update it, if the vote passes. We are now planning to post a Snapshot Poll to vote on Wednesday, December 14th. The voting parameters will be 7 days and a 40M UNI quorum. In addition to the above changes, we also pose the following question to the community. We originally proposed that changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process be votes on through an off-chain vote on Snapshot. GFX Labs 1 brought up the point that custodians do not allow voting off-chain - which means many voters may not be able to participate in those votes. Should these changes be voted on on- or off-chain? Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Below, we provide an updated version of our original post. TL;DR. One of the goals of the Uniswap Foundation 1 is to reduce the amount of friction in the community governance process. In that spirit, today we are proposing changes to that process to improve its efficiency and efficacy. We propose the following changes to the community governance process: Remove the first off-chain Snapshot poll, and replace it with a \"Request for Comment post. The first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. We also believe two off-chain votes introduces unnecessary friction. Increase quorum for the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll in the second phase to 10M UNI. The purpose of this off-chain vote is to gauge community sentiment prior to the governance vote. We believe the 10 million UNI quorum will act as a better signal than the lower quorum requirements in the current process. We also propose to formalize a process for future changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process, like the changes discussed in this proposal. As mentioned above, we are now welcoming feedback from the community on whether these changes should be voted on through an on- or off-chain vote. If you keep your UNI at a custodian, opine below! Summary. Uniswaps governance process is a core input to the communitys ability to steward its ongoing maintenance and growth in a fair and transparent manner. The design of the process should optimize for the dissemination of information throughout the community, for thoughtful iterations on proposals, and for signaling from the community prior to on-chain votes. While the governance process put in place today has, for the most part, been successful in achieving those goals, we believe improvements can be made to reduce overhead and to enhance off-chain signaling prior to the final governance vote. These process enhancements were previously discussed in the forum here, but the simplifications were never implemented. We have decided to bring them back with minor changes. Below we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change. 1297842 65.2 KB. Current Process. A detailed outline of the current process can be found here 1. Temperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 25K UNI yes-vote threshold. Consensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 50K UNI yes-vote threshold. Governance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address. Proposed changes to community governance process. Phase 1: Request for Comment. Rename: Temperature Check  Request for Comment. Removal of Snapshot off-chain vote requirement. A minimum of 7 days before moving forward. We believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions  and not require going through the friction of one of two off-chain votes. The RFC Phase should last for at least 7 days to give the community ample time to formulate opinions on the proposal and provide feedback. Phase 2: Temperature Check. Increase the required quorum from 50K to 10M UNI. For this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing the Snapshot poll yes-vote threshold to 10 million UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final phase, while being low enough for higher quality proposals to garner enough support and move on to the final phase. As suggested by Toby, we also strongly suggest the standard usage of a \"No change option in these Snapshot polls. Phase 3: On-chain Governance Vote. No changes. Proposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process. As mentioned above, we are looking for more community feedback on this topic. In her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states \"On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes. An on-chain vote is unnecessary and requires users to pay gas, so should not be required for off-chain process changes. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy. We thus originally proposed that changes to off-chain processes be voted on through off-chain votes on Snapshot with a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum (original RFC here 5) However, GFX Labs 1 made the point that custodians do not allow UNI holders to vote off-chain, which may mean some UNI is precluded from voting on those changes. We would like more community feedback on whether these kinds of changes should be voted on on- or off-chain. Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Conclusion and Next Steps. If no new serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll on Wednesday, December 14th for the community to vote on these changes. If the Snapshot receives a quorum of 40M UNI votes, the community is indicating they are in favor of these changes. The UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and work with other platforms where the Uniswap governance process is defined to make updates as well.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Pool deployed [here]([link]) Gauge deployed [here]([link]) References/Useful links: Website: [link] Documentation:[link] Transparency: [link] Github Page: [InverseFinance]([link]) Communities: [Discord]([link]) Defillama: [DOLA: TVL and stats]([link]) Protocol Description: Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community. Inverse DAOs core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation; On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finances \"Fed contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans. Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP through our Convex Fed, DOLA/USDC on Velodrome, and previously DOLA/bb-a-USD on Balancer. Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using The Stabilizer. DOLA is not \"algorithmic and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA. Motivation: This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/USDC stable pool. Inverse has previously obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA]([link]) 50-50 pool and DOLA/bb-a-USD 50-50 on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Following the recent unwinding of the DOLA/bb-a-USD LP due to a vulnerability with the implementation of our pool with the bb-a-USD pool; we are once again looking to build deep DOLA liquidity on Balancer. Platform BAL incentives would also help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. If approved, we expect to continue what was previously done for DOLA-bb-a-USD for our new veBAL gauge and are in coordination with various bribing platforms to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative. The Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA/USDC stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would once again begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer. Specifications: You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs]([link]), [governance]([link]) and our [transparency]([link]) pages. Governance: Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[Curve]([link]) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here]([link]) Equally, check out our transparency portal [here]([link]) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance. Oracles: Inverse Finances new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its wETH market. Inverse Finances old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable. Audits: As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest]([link]) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault]([link]) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners]([link]) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed]([link]), [Aura Fed]([link]), and [Velo Fed]([link]) In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product]([link]) Their report can be found [here]([link]) The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the teams formation can be found [here]([link]) Centralization vectors: Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are: Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management. Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market. Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers. Fed Chair: 2 of 6 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts. Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here]([link]) Market History: Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the \"Feds, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLAs Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLAs peg YTD. ![[image]]([link]) Currently, the deepest liquidity pool for DOLA stablecoin is DOLA/FRAXBP on Curve, with a TVL of ~$28m at the time of writing. Prior to deprecating the DOLA/bb-a-USD LP on Balancer, TVL sat at >$9.5m.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOF0i71PhfrIaonvl0F710GoHyai", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954034, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/USDC stable pool on Ethereum.

PAR is issued by Mimo Capital and jEUR by Jarvis Network. Mimo Capital and Jarvis Network co-write the proposal and have already a history of incentivising together a 4eur and a 2eur (PAR) pools on Curve for more than a year. Mimo and Jarvis both want to migrate the 2eur (PAR) pool from Curve to Balancer. References/Useful links: Jarvis Network: Link to: Website: [link] Documentation: [[link]]([link]) Code: [link] Social: [link] Audits: [link] Mimo Capital: Link to: Websites: [link] Documentation: [link] Code: [link] Social: [link] & [link] Audits: [link] Protocol Description: Jarvis Network. Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy) Mimo Capital. Mimo Protocol is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. The stablecoin (PAR) is decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro fiat currency. Motivation: The role of the 2eur (PAR) pool is to increase the stability of PAR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and jEUR (2), and connect the Mimo and Jarvis ecosystems (3) Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem. 1. PAR peg: PAR is issued following the CDP model; if PAR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy PAR cheaper and repay their debt; if PAR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow PAR and sell them at a higher price; since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the PAR peg; so if PAR trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP. 2. On-chain liquidity: PAR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap PAR to jEUR and then to USDC or ETH to access the latters liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases PAR liquidity. jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jEUR-WETH, 2eur-bb-am-usd, etc. 3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Mimo and its PAR (essentially a way to borrow Euros with various collateral) to the jEURs ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases. Credit without FX risk: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.) Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR, redeem for ETH or USDC, and repeat. DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, and a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium. This pool can help users to buy PAR with Euros or to sell PAR for Euros. A few notes: Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot) With Mimo Labs, we have been launching the 2eur (and 4eur) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $4M since August 2022, with a TVL of $0.5-$1M. Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield. Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (PAR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (PAR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs. Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (locked as vlAURA) & BAL. Mimo Labs is currently working on a proposal for the Mimo Protocol to acquire AURA & BAL then lock them. Mimo Labs will provide liquidity in the 2eur pool and use 100% of the generated fees for vote incentives veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL (Mimo Labs is also working on a proposal to whitelist their multisig for Balancers Voting Escrow. In the case where the proposal is accepted, 100% of fees generated will be locked for $veBAL instead of be used for vote incentives) Specifications: 1.

Proposes to repeal the working group rules passed in [EP4]([link]) and replace those rules with the working group rules specified in this proposal. Abstract. This is a proposal to repeal the working group rules passed in EP4 and replace those rules with working group rules specified in this proposal for the Second Term of 2022 and all Terms thereafter. The working group rules specified in this proposal add more details about Steward responsibilities and the management of working group funds, as well as introducing the requirement of each working group to appoint a lead steward. The specification below also introduces a rule to appoint a new DAO Secretary, responsible for managing working relationships and communications across working groups as well as performing administrative duties for the DAO. Specification. Working Groups Rules. 1. Formation of Working Groups. 1. To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation (Social Proposal'), must be put forward and passed by the DAO. 2. A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group. 2. Dissolution of Working Groups. 1. A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups. 2. If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of that vote. 3. Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay. 3. Working Group Stewards. 1. Each working group shall be managed by three stewards (hereafter a Steward' or Stewards') 2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a Term' or Terms') 3. There are two Terms each calendar year: 1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term (First Term'); and. 2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year (Second Term') 4. Stewards are responsible for overseeing the operation of working groups in accordance with these rules and the ENS DAO constitution. 5. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to: 1. Requesting working group funds from the DAO in accordance with these rules; 2. Approving the creation of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks; 3. Dissolving sub-groups or workstreams within a working group; 4. Using discretion to make working group funds available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group; 5. Using discretion to disburse working group funds to people and/or projects in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution; and. 6. Acting as keyholders of working group multi-sigs. 4. Steward Eligibility and Nominations. 1. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO (Eligible Person' or Eligible Persons') 2. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for First Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 (First Term Nomination Window') 3. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for Second Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on June 6 and 9am UTC on June 9 (Second Term Nomination Window') 4. An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group or working groups during the First Term Nomination Window or the Second Term Nomination Window (each a Nomination Window'), by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum. 5. An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 4.4 above during a Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window (Nominee') 5. Steward Elections. 1. Elections for working group Stewards for the First Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year (First Term Election Window') 2. Elections for working group Stewards for the Second Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on June 10 each year (Second Term Election Window') 3. The top-ranked Nominees from each working group vote held during a First Term Election Window or a Second Term Election Window (each an 'Election Window'), will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the Term immediately following an Election Window, based on the order in which they are ranked in each working group vote. 4. A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during a single Term. 6. Delay of Nominations or Elections. 1. In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process and/or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 4 and 5 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window. 2. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced. 3. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 6.2 above, for the remainder of that Term. 7. Removal and Replacement of Stewards. 1. Stewards may be removed at any time by: 1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or. 2. a simple indicative majority vote among Stewards of all working groups, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum. 2. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum. 3. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, a new election must be held to fill any vacant Steward positions, in accordance with rule 6 above. 8. Lead Stewards. 1. Each working group must appoint a lead Steward within the first five days of a Term (hereafter a 'Lead Steward' or 'Lead Stewards\") 2. Only current elected Stewards of a working group are eligible to serve as Lead Stewards within a given working group. 3. Lead Stewards may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a working group, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum. 4. In the event that a Lead Steward steps down from the position or is removed as a Lead Steward before the end of a Term in accordance with rule 8.3 above, a new Lead Steward must be appointed within five calendar days. 5. A Steward who is appointed to serve as a Lead Steward of a working group will remain in that position, as Lead Steward, from the date of appointment until the end of their elected Term as a Steward or until they are removed as a Lead Steward in accordance with rule 8.3 above or until they are removed as a Steward in accordance with rule 7 above. 6. Lead Stewards are responsible for the operational management and administration of working groups and are expected to provide regular updates to the DAO in the ENS governance forum related to working group progress, achievements, and challenges. 7. The responsibilities of Lead Stewards include, but are not limited to: 1. Acting as a representative of a working group; 2. Managing resource requests from sub-groups, workstreams, and contributors within a working group; 3. Initiating the disbursement of working group funds on an as-needed basis; 4.

To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation ('Collective Proposal'), to the DAO during the months of January, April, July, and October each calendar year (each a Funding Window') 1. In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window. 2. In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation, may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO. 2. Working group funds requested and approved in accordance with rule 10.1 above are to be paid out into separate working group multi-sigs controlled by the DAO. 3. Each working group multi-sig must have four keyholders, made up of three current elected Stewards for that working group and the Secretary of the DAO for that Term, with no other keyholders permitted. 4.

Angle Protocol and Jarvis Network co-write the proposal and already have a history of incentivizing together a 4eur and a 2eur (agEUR) pools on Curve for more than a year. Angle and Jarvis want to migrate the 2eur (agEUR) pool from Curve to Balancer. References/Useful links: Jarvis Network: Link to: Website: [link] Documentation: [[link]]([link]) Code: [link] Social: [link] Audits: [link] Angle Protocol: Link to: Website: [[link]]([link]) Documentation: [link] Code: [link] Social: [link] Audits: [link] Protocol Description: Jarvis Network. Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks. The Synthereum protocol has four modules: Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed. Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types. Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio. Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools. Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy, Dotdot, etc.) Angle Protocol. Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has launched agEUR, a Euro stablecoin, which has become one of the biggest decentralized Euro stablecoin. The TVL in the Angle Protocol is $46m with 30m agEUR in circulation. There are different mechanisms (also called modules) by which agEUR can be issued all having in common that agEUR must be released on the market in an over-collateralized way. - In the Core module of the protocol, agEUR can be minted from USDC, DAI and FRAX at oracle value. The protocol insures itself against the $/ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by relying on the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol and by transaction fees. agEUR issued from this means represent the biggest share of the agEUR in circulation, and they are currently over-collateralized at 200% - The protocol also has a borrowing module where agEUR can be borrowed against different assets (ETH, wBTC, wstETH) like on Maker. This module is deployed on different chains (including Polygon) - The protocol is also engaged in algorithmic market operations (also called direct deposit modules) It has for instance minted agEUR natively on Aave and on Euler. In these cases, agEUR enter in circulation when they are borrowed in an over-collateralized way on the corresponding protocol. Protocol also mints agEUR on the agEUR-EUROC Curve pool when this pool has more EUROC than agEUR (like what FRAX is doing) [agEUR]([link]) has kept a super tight peg since its launch. It is involved in several other gauges on Curve as well (agEUR-EURs-EURt, agEUR-ibEUR, agEUR-EUROC-cEUR, agEUR-EUROC) which have historically yielded a pretty important volume. Motivation: The role of the 2eur (agEUR) pool is to increase the stability of agEUR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both agEUR and jEUR (2), and connect the Angle and Jarvis ecosystems (3) Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem. 1. agEUR peg: on Polygon, agEUR is issued following the CDP model; if agEUR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy agEUR cheaper and repay their debt; if agEUR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow agEUR and sell them at a higher price; users can also perform a cross-chain arbitrage between Ethereum and Polygon (since on Ethereum one can swap agEUR for USDC at the EURUSD Chainlink price feed without price impact) but since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact on Polygon, arbitrages can be directly performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the agEUR peg. 2. On-chain liquidity: agEUR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH, MAI or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap agEUR to jEUR and then to USDC, MAI or ETH to access the latters liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases agEUR liquidity. jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and agEUR has a deep liquidity on Polygon, to which jEUR can connect. 3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Angle and its agEUR liquidity and ecosystem to the jEURs, enabling multiple use cases. Credit without FX risk: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.) or agEUR (Mt Pelerin, Monerium, .) Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR, swap for ETH, MAI or USDC, and repeat. DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: both agEUR and jEUR have a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Mt Pelerin, but it comes with a high fee. jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, so this pool can help users to buy agEUR with Euros or to sell agEUR for Euros. A few notes: Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions. Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot) With Angle, we have been launching the 2eur (agEUR) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $14M since April 2022, with a TVL of $1-$3M, $6.9M of which were pure arbitrages. It is the most traded 2eur pool among PAR, EURT, EURS and EURe. Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield. Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (agEUR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs.

Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put Weighted and ComposableStable pools in Recovery Mode. Authorize Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to manage the RecoveryModeEnabler contract. Motivation. It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to 'getRate' reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pools internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction. In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper]([link]), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts. The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache. When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool. The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts. The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. The initial set includes the [ComposableStable]([link]) and [Weighted]([link]) pool factories deployed in September. If approved, this proposal will also authorize the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to add/remove factories to/from this set - but in addition to that safety mechanism, permissions will still have to be granted by Governance for each new factory individually just like in this proposal.

If you think Lido DAO should update the existing policy and enact the updated version, vote For. If you are against this proposal, vote Against. Below is a summary of changes to the policy included in the v2.0 proposal: - Set expectation of full-scale rollout of \"PBS lite via MEV Boost for all Node Operators going forward. - Define responsibilities of Node Operators in the case of Relay misbehavior, failure, or otherwise unexpected or non-performant functionality (e.g. what happens if relays provide bad bids, bad blocks, don't unblind timely, etc) - Define the responsibilities of Relay Operators towards the Lido Protocol and Node Operators Additionally, by voting For, the below is also ratified: - Propose to empower the [Relay Maintenance Committee]([link]) to facilitate the maintenance of the Lido vetted relay lists. - The Relay Maintenance committee will be a 5/7 Gnosis Safe multisig and have the address [[link]]([link]) - The initial members of the multisig, as per the post linked above, will be: - PhilKnows eth:[hexadecimals] - Elias eth:[hexadecimals] - Michael Sproul eth:[hexadecimals] - Izzy eth:[hexadecimals] - Sisyphos eth:[hexadecimals] - George eth:[hexadecimals] - YorickDowne eth:[hexadecimals] - The Relay Maintenance Committee will be made the 'manager' of the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List smart contract ([[hexadecimals]]([link])) (this will occur via an on-chain Aragon vote if this proposal passes) Below are excerpts of the sections of the policy with substantial changes. --- D.4.II Monitoring & Penalties Specification Lido should monitor, record, and assess non-compliance with this policy. Monitoring and follow-up actions should include at least the following: - Assessing whether the correct fee recipient has been configured by the [Node Operators]([link]) for the validators that they operate. - Assessing from which source proposed blocks by the validators have been received (and if that source is appropriate) - Assessing the general availability of the allowed sources for block bids around the time of each block being proposed. - Assessing, in cases where blocks were not constructed via chosen MEV infrastructure, if this was due to a min-bid-like setting and whether the value of the min-bid used in these cases conforms to the expectations set by the Policy. - Assessing, in cases where blocks were not constructed via chosen MEV infrastructure, whether the block proposed contained transactions not available in the public mempool. - Recording, on a per-block basis, the most valuable known block bids offered via accepted MEV infrastructure (and block bid sources, e.g. relays), i.e. the reference block. - Recording, on a per-block basis, the blocks actually produced by the validators and their total value, i.e. the actual block. - Analyzing, on a per-block basis and historically, the difference between the reference block and the actual block for each Node Operator participating in Lido, having also properly taken into account the effect that min-bid usage would have on such a difference. Some leeway should be given to Node Operators for potential network problems, faulty relays, min-bid usage, or buggy software outside their control. It should be enough for the Lido DAO to punish gross misbehavior when a Node Operator is deviating more than ALLOWED_VALUE_DEV% from the reference block, on a frequency basis more than ALLOWED_FREQ_DEV% of the time over a rolling time window DEV_WINDOW. These parameters can be reviewed and tweaked via governance, if needed. . D.5 Currently prescribed solution(s) This section will be reviewed by the DAO and updated on an at-least yearly basis and more often if needed. It details which block production solutions may be used by Node Operators at the current time. Applicability period: 2022/11/1 - 2023/6/30. (Unless otherwise overriden by a superceding DAO vote) Summary: 2022/Q4 - 2023/Q2 MEV-Boost Full-scale Adoption - Phase 1. Lido should aid Ethereum in moving towards its stated goal, PBS. Following the Merge, Node Operators were requested to roll out and use MEV-Boost for validators that they operate as a part of the Lido protocol via a soft-rollout approach. They were asked to use as many of the relays which had signaled interest for inclusion as possible in order to test the efficacy and performance of the relays. Following the soft-rollout period and going forward, Node Operators are expected to adhere to the following: 1. The DAO will hold a Snapshot vote to: - determine which MEV-Boost relays will be added to the initial \"must-include list and \"allow list (\"relay lists) - for ease of governance operations given the number of new relays being created and the need for haste in certain scenarios, identify and approve a set of multi-sig participants who will manage the relay lists (the \"Relay Maintenance Committee (RMC)) for the duration of Phase 1, or until the management of the relay lists can be moved to [Lido Easy Track]([link]) - delegate authority to the RMC to make decisions about which relays are added to or moved between the \"relay lists, provided that RMC decisions are posted publicly on the Lido research forums prior to any on-chain actions being taken and giving the DAO and community a reasonable amount of time to consider. The DAO retains the right to a final decision and community members may post a Snapshot vote to change or counteract RMC decisions and/or reconstitute the RMC with different participants. 2. Validators operated by Node Operators participating in the Lido protocol shall be configured to produce blocks via the MEV-Boost infrastructure (or equivalent, such as Vouchs MEV-Service) as detailed in [Appendix A.1]([link]), by obtaining sealed blocks from the maximum possible number of relays from Lidos \"must-include list (those used will be determined by each Node Operator based on their own risk and legal assessment) and an optional number of relays from the \"allow list. NOTE: the use of \"must here is effectively \"must use some, not \"must use all. The purpose is to promote relay diversity (and thus builder diversity) Node Operators may elect to not use all the relays from the \"must-include list, but the entirety of that list is used as a basis for the formation of the reference block as described in [Monitoring & Penalties]([link]) 3. In Phase 1, Node Operators may also opt-in to configure a min-bid value in MEV-Boost ranging from 0 (default) to a preliminary upper maximum to be determined based on community alignment and agreement and published on the Lido Research Forums ([min-bid discussion thread]([link])) The effects of usage of min-bid shall be incorporated into the allowable deviation parameters discussed in [Monitoring & Penalties]([link]), such that only egregious and/or non-community aligned (including but not limited to values and usage that would be substantially detrimental to protocol APR) values of min-bid would result in a Node Operator being penalized. The effects of min-bid implementation will be analyzed and shared with the DAO during Phase 1 to determine and codify a more specific policy. 4. If using MEV-boost infrastructure leads to any operational failures/difficulties (such as, but not limited to: failing to produce valid blocks, failing to produce blocks at all, received rewards being incorrect, or lack of availability of appropriate relays), the Node Operator shall refer to and act as per the guidelines in [A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting]([link]) 5. Blocks produced by the validators will be monitored as per [Monitoring & Penalties]([link]) section and the monitoring section of the relevant Appendices. If as at the time of the start of the applicability period the \"MEV Monitoring & Penalty parameters have not yet been defined, a grace period will be instituted until such a time that the parameters are defined and ratified by the DAO, at which point this policy will be updated. 6. Node Operators acting in violation of the policy are subject to penalties as described in the [Monitoring & Penalties]([link]) section. Prior to the end of the Phase 1 of the Full-Scale Adoption period, or as soon as possible thereafter, the DAO will review and update (via a vote) this policy, in order to: - re-confirm or amend the prescribed solution if deemed necessary and set the new applicability period for the next phase policy; - stipulate or amend the values for the MEV Monitoring & Penalty parameters; and. - indicate any updates or refinements to be put in place regarding Monitoring Mechanisms. . A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting In the case that operational issues are noticed (e.g. blocks not produced as expected, blocks not being timely unblinded, blocks not being timely created and propagated, blocks being invalid are invalid, relays not providing agreed upon data or monitoring APIs, etc.) the Node Operator should temporarily disable the relevant relay(s) until such a time that: - (a) service is sufficiently and satisfactorily restored, or. - (b) the DAO and Node Operators collectively decide that the relay(s) should no longer be used and removed from the relevant vetted lists, at which point a DAO vote should be made to do so. In these cases, the Node Operator should also: - timely inform the rest of the Lido Node Operator community about the issues identified, - reach out to the Lido Node Operator Management contributors to notify them of the issues, and. - reach out to the relay operator to understand the source of the issue and report back. If a Node Operator is found to be \"under-performing\" as per the mechanism described in D.4 Monitoring & Penalties but this is due to issues stemming from a bad relay or malicious builders interfering with block production, then the Operator will not considered out of compliance with the policy. A.1.V Relay & Relay Operator Responsibilities and Incident Management Given the trusted nature of relays in the MEV-Boost context, it behooves Relay Operators to ensure that they and the relays that they operate function effectively, performantly, and efficiently, and that any and all communications are made timely and professionally. Relay Operators should notify relevant Lido protocol participants (e.g. Node Operators, the Node Operator Management Workstream) as soon as possible upon identification of an issue with any of the relays that they operate. Notification may be performed through public ([Lido forum]([link]), Lido discord, etc.) and/or private channels (e.g. group chats) available to them, so that Node Operators can proceed with appropriate changes to their MEV-Boost configurations. During an incident, Relay Operators should provide regular updates with regards to the status of the incident. Following the conclusion of the incident, Relay Operators should provide an incident report (or post-mortem) that details at minimum the root cause, fixes performed, if/how soon the relay will be back in service, and what steps have been undertaken to prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. Additionally, in cases where block production was adversely affected (see A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting), Relay Operators should advise as to what steps will be taken (if any) to reimburse validators for any missed/lost/invalid/etc. blocks and/or incorrect/invalid/inaccurate bids. Incidents will be reviewed on an ad-hoc basis by the Node Operator and Lido DAO communities. These reviews will inform DAO decisions (via vote) regarding whether Relay Operators and the relays that they operate will continue to be considered vetted and ratified for use by Node Operators or not. Relays which exhibit poor or otherwise unacceptable communication and especially performance (such as, but not limited to, inability to performantly and timely register validators, inability to performantly and timely send/receive bids and payloads, not verify bids, not simulate payload validity etc.), and/or fail to conform with the expectations outlined above with regards to incident management (as determined by the DAO and Node Operator communities) will be subject to removal from the Lido-approved relay lists.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOF0Nk2gPIzYf1YkyMaFeoqHtEVw", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954034, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests updating the Block Proposer Rewards Policy to include several changes.

Author(s): GFX Labs . Contributors: Status: RFC. Date Posted: 2022-12-17. ' Motivation. An edge case has been identified in how delegates self-report their participation under this trial. When a poll is open during two different reporting periods, it leads to confusion on whether that poll should be first counted for delegate compensation purposes. There has also been interest from delegates in a linear penalty vs a cliff for compensation. Summary of Amendments. 1. Clarification that a poll is only counted for participation once that poll has closed (in the \"Reporting & Administration section) 2. Removal of the preamble that is no longer relevant (prior the \"Motivation section) 3. Inserted a link to a Dune query to help delegates calculate their HOP for a period; removed language stating that a query would be made after HIP 4 was approved (in the \"Reporting & Administration section) 4. Added the exact date the delegation trial will sunset now that date is known (in the \"Sunset section) 5. Lowered the threshold for minimum participation for delegates to be eligible from 90% to 70% on both voting and communication (in the \"Eligibility section) Added a penalty to delegates with participation or communication of at least 70% but less than 90% (in the \"Specifications & Incentives Paid section) New Text For HIP 4 In Full (Additions In Bold; Removals In Strike Marks): ~~This is a request for comment (RFC),[in line with current Hop governance processes]([link]), intended to provide a place for comment and feedback to be incorporated before moving it to a temperature check and requesting a sponsor to create a formal Hop Proposal.~~ ~~As per the instructions in Phase I (RFC), the question posed is: \"Should Hop governance incentivize participation by delegates under this trial program?~~ ~~GFX Labs, Flipside Crypto, and Franco Macklis are all under the 1 million HOP threshold to initiate a formal vote if the temperature check is successful.~~ Motivation. Hops governance is new, with a need to decentralize control and oversight of the protocol. This trial program aims to attract and retain both entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of HOP token-holders. Sunset. This program is intended to be a temporary trial and will end after 6 months unless it is extended through a governance vote, which is March 10, 2023. Eligibility. Minimum Participation Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a ~~90%~~ 70% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any \"temperature check or on-chain governance vote. Minimum Communication Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a ~~90%~~ 70% communication rate. Participation is measured as providing for any \"temperature check or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate. Measurement Period: Both minimum requirements will be measured on a 6-month basis, which is also the intended length of this trial. If this program is renewed, participation and communication requirements will continue to be measured on a rolling 6-month (182-day) basis. Minimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least 90,000 HOP voting weight. Specifications For Incentives Paid. Delegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more. The formula for delegate incentives is: I = (log(h)-4.55)3500. I = Incentives to be received. h = lowest level of HOP delegated that month If the lower of a delegates communication or participation metrics are at least 70%, but less than 90%, a penalty is applied to compensation. The formula for the penalty is: c = (9 - p) 3 c = Penalty to incentives, expressed as a percentage p = min(participation, communication) Example: A delegate has 82% participation and 100% communication. They would have been eligible for 100 HOP in compensation. Because their participation was only 82%, a penalty of 24% is applied. A 24% penalty would reduce the 100 HOP compensation to 76 HOP. This formula targets ~1400 HOP for a delegate at the minimum threshold. At the time of writing, 20 delegates qualify for the minimum eligibility threshold. For reference, a few benchmarks: a delegate holding all 1 billion HOP would receive 12,075 HOP per month. 10 million HOP, a delegate would receive 8,575 HOP per month. 1 million HOP, a delegate would receive 5,075 HOP per month. 100,000 HOP, a delegate would receive 1,575 HOP per month. This formulas slope was chosen to provide the targeted levels of minimum and maximum compensation and is open to revision at the close of this trial. In general, it was selected to provide a slower accumulation of incentives for larger delegates than smaller ones, while preserving a noticeable increase at all levels (under the maximum cap) for any delegate that can attract more delegated HOP votes. [This link provides a graph and visualization for those interested.]([link]) Reporting & Administration. Delegate compensation will be paid directly to delegate addresses (or their assigned alternative address) by the Community Multi-Sig. For this trial, delegates must self-report that they have met the 90% participation and 90% communication thresholds each month to receive delegate incentives. Each delegate should also self-report the lowest level of HOP they were delegated that month and the number of incentives they are eligible to receive. ~~To ease this workload, Flipside Crypto will create a query where delegates can input their address and view an undisputed lowest level of delegated HOP that month.~~ To ease this workload, a Dune query has been created by @shanefontaine. [The query can be found here.]([link]) If the delegate wishes the HOP to be sent to an address other than their delegate address, they should also specify that address in their monthly self-reporting. Delegates are reminded that HOP incentive payments will be public and on-chain. This self-reporting will occur on the [Hop Forum]([link]) under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. In the event a community member disputes (with evidence) the self-reported metrics of a delegate, it is up to the Community Multisig to determine whether a discrepancy was in bad faith. The Community Multisig is authorized to exclude any delegate from this program for the remainder of the 6-month trial if such a dispute occurs. For clarity, delegates should self-report using the following formulae: Vote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon  all proposals) 100. Communication participation percent = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position  all proposals) 100. Proposals include all \"temperature check polls on Snapshot as well as formal on-chain polls. Only submissions after the date of approval of this program  for 6 months  are to be considered for this reporting. Only votes that have concluded are to be included at the time of reporting; any polls still open are not to be included in participation metrics.

Featherproof secures large applications like CAKE, BTC.b, and TheAptosBridge and offers a drastic reduction in gas  reducing gas costs by over 20% Gas costs have commonly and repeatedly been brought up as one of the largest limiting factors of the current Stargate implementation, this would be a massive improvement in that. Proposal. Stargate should adopt Featherproof. This would result in a bare minimum cost of 20% less gas in all transactions and in certain edge cases (such as aggregators) can result in more than 90% less gas cost. A more consistent and significantly cheaper gas cost will make Stargate more usable, more frequently utilized within all third party routing, and offer a significantly better user experience to all. Execution. A configuration change to the relayer Stargate uses would need to happen for this to be enabled. Stargate will need to select Featherproof as its validation library rather than ULNv2. This can be done near immediately after this proposal passes. Success. If successful, Stargates gas usage will decrease by at least 20% This will give Stargate an edge in an a bridge landscape that is growing more competitive over time. It will also improve user experience when interacting with Stargate by lowering the amount paid by the user. Upon success, Stargate will become significantly more competitive in the overall landscape for gas pricing and will reduce gas usage of at least 20% Reducing gas cost will also improve user experience, rate of inclusion in aggregators, and generally reduce friction on the end user by a meaningful amount.

References Project: [link] Whitepaper: [link] Twitter: [link] Codebase: [link] Documentation: [link] App (list of front-ends): [link] Audit - Coinspect - March 21: [link] Audit - TrailOfBits Security Assessment: [link] Audit - TrailOfBits Liquity Protocol and Stability Pool Financial Report - March 21: [link] Audit - TrailOfBits Liquity Proxy Contracts Report - March 21: [link] LUSD token contract: [link] Discord: [link] Paragraph Summary. LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet. LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH) Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110% Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities. Since the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD. LUSDs resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases. This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV) If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit. Specifications. AIP author status. I, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined]([link]) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy. Overview of the project and token. Liquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences: Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocols trustlessness and resilience. There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5%  and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol. Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool]([link]), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users. Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system]([link]) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent. Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol  [LQTY]([link]), but its used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only. The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower  at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150% Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol. Positioning within Aave Ecosystem. LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing. Furthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further: 1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%) 2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live. 3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode. I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable. History of the project and its components. The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve. Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply  this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully  a recap is available here: [link] ![image]([link]) Since the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable: A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. Its amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes. DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management. B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: [link] Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price. LUSD usage. A sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: [link] The top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries. LUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC) LUSD Emission. The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur) Token & Protocol Permissions. The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance. Market Data. As of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved. The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: [link] There are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: [link] There is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: [link] Finally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC [link] The observed volume can vary depending on the markets activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only) Social channel data. The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K) Contract Related Information. Deployment of the LUSD contract - 05 April 2021: [link] The first minting of LUSD - 05 April 2021: [link] Number of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism) Number of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism) Risk Assessment. We followed [Aaves risk assessment methodology]([link]) to provide all the necessary metrics: I'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the \"Permission\" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH.

Payout Ratio to the Treasury will stay in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. Premise of the proposal is roughly the same from the signal vote, but with clear guidelines set in place for the timeline of the enacted proposal. The proposal ensures that the 100% ratio of fees to the Treasury will only be in effect for a maximum of one year from when the signal vote passed on Dec 19th 2022. Thus, this means that a hard-stop will be in place for Dec 19th 2023 and the Kanpai payout ratio will revert back to 10% to Treasury and 100% to Sushi Bar. Also, implementation of new tokenomics will also be a cause for a hard stop on the fee re-direct and migrating to the new structure once its passed through governance/development and is ready to integrate. Additionally, a governance dashboard will be developed to give full transparency & insights into the operations budget and the treasurys assets. To summarize the proposal seeks to direct 100% of the revenue earned through fees to the Treasury, with two conditions causing a hard stop: 1. A year has passed with no tokenomics in place (Dec 19th 2023) 2. New tokenomics being implemented. Revenue to the treasury will be in the form of 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass.

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows the creation of a money market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token that is part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers, or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. Fraxlend creates new financial opportunities for all users and promotes FRAX adoption in the DeFi community. Since FIP - 137 authorized the Fraxlend AMO to issue a new FPI pair (FPI/FRAX - Variable Rate V2), the pool has generated significant protocol revenues, as well as heavy lending and borrowing activity. Current pool utilization stands at 91% with total FPI collateral value at $17.8m. At time of writing, the lender APY is at 5.7% and borrower APY is at 6.2% Both rates are rising quickly. Building on the success of the FPI pool, additional AMO injected liquidity would help bring the target pool utilization back down to the nominal range of 75% to 85% More importantly, raising the liquidity cap would expand and diversify the borrower base to increase financial access for all users. We note that authorizing the new higher limit does not require the AMO to provide the specified liquidity. The liquidity will be authorized and available to be injected, consistent with the AMO operations framework and protocol risk parameters, to meet user demand as deemed appropriate by the Frax Team.

Ribbon Finance intends to mass migrate liquidity from the primary RBN-USDC Uniswap v2/v3 pools to the RBN/USDC 50/50 Balancer pool. If the gauge is added, the Ribbon DAO will provide [25,000 RBN bi-weekly]([link]) as voting incentives for the first two months. Aura Finance will match any incentives provided by Ribbon to help bootstrap liquidity. I propose that this gauge also be entered as a \"core pool under BIP-19 because this will be the primary on-chain RBN liquidity, Ribbon is heavily incentivizing, and the RBN circulating mcap is ~$100M. The pool will most likely be generating significant swap fees. References/Useful links: > Link to:  [Website]([link])  [Documentation]([link])  [Github Page]([link])  [Communities]([link]) Protocol Description: RBN is the governance token for the Ribbon Finance protocol. Ribbon is the first and largest DOV (decentralized options vaults) product. We make it easy to sell options on BTC, ETH, and alts. TVL is ~$60M. Similar to Balancer, Ribbon also has a ve mechanism in which holders can lock RBN to accrue protocol revenue from the options vaults. Motivation: The fees and volume are partially driven by Balancers automated voting weight for Core Pools from Balancer Improvement Proposal 19. Furthermore, if the LP is approved for a gauge and receiving automatic voting weight, liquidity providers can earn additional yield through Aura Finances ability to boost BAL emissions and supplement with AURA emissions too. Voting incentives for Aura holders has hovered around 2x in capital efficiency (Source on Llama airforce) over the last month. Meaning, if RBN or other rewards were provided to help bootstrap the liquidity it would be more capital efficient than typical liquidity mining. Specifications: 1. Governance: Ribbon governance info can be seen [here]([link]) and their snapshot [here]([link]) Ribbon Finance DAO [multisig]([link]) 2.

Deposit $77M DAI into the the DAI Savings Rate Earn Strategy. Motivation. MakerDAO recently increased the DAI savings rate (DSR) to 1% as a result of the revenues earned by their Real-World Asset (RWA) activities. Olympus Treasury being one of the largest DAI holder, should take advantage of the new savings rate to increase its revenues. Risk Assessment. The DSR contract has been live since November 2019, was audited by Trail of Bits, has held at its peak usage over $350M of DAI holders assets and to this date has not suffered any exploit. This makes the Dai Savings Rate smart contract one of the oldest and most battle-tested set of code in the Defi ecosystem. Due to the time in production and significant TVL over time the DSR contract is seen as a low risk contract by the treasury team. The allocator contract is developed by Olympus, and is an adapted copy of the same allocator contract that is used for all other treasury assets held in allocators (Fraxswap, CVX, Aave etc) The Olympus allocator has been used for a long time with significant value. The risk of asset loss is seen as low by the treasury team. However, this specific allocator deployment is not audited and therefor we suggest that the significant treasury reserve deposit is done in two tranches. It is proposed that a first deposit of 1M DAI is done to encourage potential exploit of the allocator contract. After 2 weeks this is followed by the main deposit. How Does the DSR work? - Dai holders can lock their Dai into the DSR smart contract at any time. Once locked, Dai continuously accrues to the users balance, based on the current DSR. - Dai holders can earn savings automatically and natively while retaining control of their Dai. The DSR smart contract has no withdrawal limits, deposit limits, or liquidity constraints. Source: [link] In regards to Treasury assets needed to conduct market operations under RBS, note that: - Deposit and withdrawals can be done at any moment. There are no lock-ups and no fees for using the Dai Savings Rate. - Twice the total of DAI used by RBS for the last completed month will remain unstaked in the Olympus Treasury. Initially, the RBS contract/ new Treasury would be replenished when/if needed by executing withdrawals manually from the DSR contracts. Eventually, RBS contract will be able to interact directly with the DSR contract which would remove the need for an intermediary manual transaction. Execution. Deposit 1M DAI from reserves to DAI Savings Rate module via Olympus Allocator. After 2 weeks follow up with the main $76M deposit. References.

We can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and [Quadrat Protocol]([link]) for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users. Security and Governance Bridge. 0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using [Celer Bridge]([link]) for the Governance cross-chain messaging. Here is a piece of information about the Celer Bridge provided by @modong. A quick introduction to Celer: Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users. How to build Uniswaps cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models) Celer IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap]([link]) since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the [application design pattern]([link]) When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage]([link]) of a \"send box contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision. This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain. A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call [executeMessage]([link]) of a \"receive box contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract. The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain. However, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the second security model: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a \"quarantine zone for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from \"trust majority stake to \"trust any with app developers capable of running one of the \"any App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module. Once the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process. Next, we answer the questions raised in the post. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Of course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? This is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description. As discussed above, Celers generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celers security models: Celer comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis. 1. Cosmos-consensus Security Model. By default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELRs value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions. 2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model (what should be used in this case) !(upload://8uf1PmN8Xra57O4ORLU5SjzZ2AW) So, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario. Instead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be \"committed to the blockchain by SGN into a \"quarantine zone for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be \"confirmed and pushed to the final destination application. During this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celers construct will still maintain safety property without any concern. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the \"trust-any model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain. This is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Their CELR stake will be slashed. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Celer was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

A budget of $115,000/month ($1.38m/year) will cover Authereum Labss costs for providing these services and allow Authereum Labs to bring on two additional team members to help with the workload. While costs vary month to month, this a rough breakdown of expected costs: | Item | Cost (monthly) | |---|:---:| | Employee expenses | $80,000 | | Office | $4,000 | | Legal | $6,000 | | Software and web services | $10,000 | | Security Audits | $12,000 | | Miscellaneous | $3,000 | | Total | $115,000 | Accountability. Authereum Labs will provide quarterly written updates for Hop DAO detailing our contributions over the previous quarter as well as providing guidance around upcoming deliverables, potential blockers, or unknowns. We will also provide more granular updates and make ourselves available for questions and feedback on Hop Community Calls currently run at a biweekly cadence. Lastly, we will continue to solicit feedback and buy-in from the DAO for changes or new developments in the product roadmap. We reserve the right to manage our internal structure and costs within the budget granted by Hop DAO but want to provide transparency into these decisions while respecting individual privacy. We also reserve the right to conduct open-ended research that can be presented to the DAO as a possible future direction for the protocol as we have done with the Hop Core Messenger and v2 roadmap. Execution. Should this proposal be accepted via the full governance process, the Hop Foundation will be empowered to enter into a standard service provider agreement (SPA) with Authereum Labs on behalf of Hop DAO. In addition to the payment terms above, the SPA would provide for customary mutual indemnity clauses, and all intellectual property developed under the SPA would belong to Hop DAO. Monthly payments should be made in stablecoins at the end of each month starting with January. Should Hop DAO not have stablecoins, payment can be defered until they are available for use in payment. All payments should be made from the Community Multisig when possible. The Community Multisig should hold approximately 4 months of expenses, refilled via on-chain governance vote every other month.

SD - USDC pool. 2. 80% SD - 20% WETH pool Utility SD (Stader Token) is Stader Labs' protocol token. Users can use SD tokens to participate in governance decisions. With SD staking planned to go live soon, SD token holders will be able to get a share of the protocol revenue. Currently SD tokens are used to incentivize liquidity provisioning, as bribes to veBAL voters and as direct rewards to partner DeFi protocols across 6 different blockchains where Stader offers its Liquid Staked Derivative tokens (Polygon, BNB, Hedera, Fantom, Near, Terra 2.0) and will go live soon on Ethereum as well with the ETHx token SD distribution ![[image]]([link]) [Link to litepaper]([link]) Motivation SD currently has ~ $43M in trading volume over the last 30 days across centralized exchanges & DEXes. Most of the current SD liquidity resides in the form of a SD-USDC Uni v2 pool worth $450K. Despite the small size the pool has generated L7D volumes of ~$3M. Stader labs would like to deepen the liquidity for the SD token on ETH to support low slippage transactions. The upcoming launch of the ETHx (liquid staked Ethereum derivative token) in Feb'23 would also lead to an inflow of SD tokens on the ETH network leading to an increase in trading volumes from current levels for the token. Hence Stader would like to create 2 SD pools on ETH balancer and incentivize liquidity through bribes: 1. SD-USDC pool (low slippage for trades) 2. 80SD-20WETH pool (low impermanent loss for SD liquidity providers) Stader on Balancer Stader has a great partnership with the Balancer DAO, with 2 pools already present: 1. MaticX-WMATIC ($9.4M TVL, 12.3% APY) 2. 80SD-20MaticX ($92K TVL, 95% APY) Stader has spent over $600K in terms of direct SD incentivization and bribes on Hidden Hand over the last 6 months and have promoted the pools through our marketing channels and embedded it into secondary yield products (like vaults, automated strategies) through partners Specifications Governance Stader protocol is governed by the SD token. Holders can actively participate in governance decisions and share feedback on proposals put forward by the protocol. The following decisions will follow the governance mechanism process: Any implication on smart contract parameters for liquid staking Changes to validator selection criteria Changes to fees SD token related Treasury management and SD staking.

The FXPools have various parameters (read more [link]) that affect the range of FX accurate swaps across the bonding curve. These parameters are updated and optimized over time, thus the need for nimble response while the pool is new. 2. Oracles: The EURS:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the \"beta region), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the \"beta region where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the \"beta region, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the \"beta region.

Status: Snapshot-only HIP. ' There have been several conversations among community members regarding introducing protocol fees for Hop. Currently, fees go solely toward paying supply-side participants such as AMM LPs and Bonders. There have been $7m total fees collected to date! Even a small protocol fee would provide significant funding to help cover general DAO expenses such as development costs, grant programs, foundation costs, and more. With the development of Hop v2, we have the opportunity to introduce a Protocol Fee Switch to each module (messaging, token bridge, nft bridge, etc.) to help cover general costs in the DAO. The introduction of a Protocol Fee Switch also gives us the opportunity to enshrine a commitment to public goods funding directly into the protocol. Its important to remember that Hop is built on the shoulders of giants. We wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Ethereum and the many other public goods that exist because of the Ethereum community. Diverting a portion of fees would allow Hop to give back to the Ethereum community and the broader world perpetually through public goods funding. Proposal. A protocol fee switch should be added to each Hop module produced by Hop DAO. In addition, a minimum of 10% of fees collected by the DAO from each module should be diverted to public goods funding outside of the immediate Hop ecosystem. Execution. All protocol fees will be initialized in an off position. The protocol fee can only be set by a direct on-chain vote after the full governance process. The minimum public goods funding percentage can be enshrined directly into each fee collection mechanism.

Context. Angle has reserves in USDC, DAI and FRAX which are invested in yield strategies. Yield from these yield strategies is then distributed to SLPs, to veANGLE holders and a portion goes into the protocol reserves. So far, as described in [the docs]([link]), Angle yield strategies consist in lending to Aave, Compound (and Euler for DAI) and the funds go to the lending venue that that has the highest APR. This strategy however is inefficient, and better can be done. Imagine having to allocate funds to a basket of 3 strategies yielding an APR. In DeFi usually, the more you lend to a place the lower your APR. And so instead of lending [0,0,100] to 3 protocols, you may very often be better off lending like [0,30,70] or like [10,30,60] to optimize the global APR you're getting. Lending everything on Euler may give you more than lending everything on Compound or on Aave, but you may be better off not lending everything you can on Euler, and instead allocating some funds to Aave and Compound. This kind of optimization is tricky to do on-chain. This requires complex math problems to solve, which depending on how the protocols are coded do not even always have closed forms off-chain. The good solution to take advantage of this is to have a strategy that can take suggestions from the people harvesting it when it comes to the new allocation of funds between the different lending venues. Yet, doing this without any check in a full permissionless setting is not ideal. On the one hand, an adverse player could tell the strategy to invest all its funds to a venue with little to no yield thus harming the protocol revenues. On the other hand, making strategy harvests permissioned is not ideal as well. You need to trust the bot (or the address) harvesting the strategy for being always up, for not being hacked or for working efficiently at all times. Proposal. The proposal is to amend the 'OptimizerAPR' yield strategy in the following way: anyone can harvest the strategy and suggest an allocation of funds to the different underlying venues, and before moving the funds, the strategy checks on chain if the proposed allocation is effectively better than the current allocation. If it is better, the strategy moves to the new allocation, if not, the strategy stays in the same state and just invests its idle funds in the highest yielding lending venue. Implementation. The advantage of this change is that it requires very little changes to the existing strategy engine of the protocol ([this contract]([link]) in particular) And so rather than deploying new contracts, it just requires upgrading the following contracts: - 'OptimizerAPRStrategy': for both DAI and USDC. - 'GenericLender' for Aave, Compound and Euler for DAI and USDC. On Euler, we propose to take advantage of the staking facility to earn an additional yield made up of EUL tokens. Value to the protocol. In normal conditions, if no one runs a bot, this should have absolutely no effect on the lending yield the protocol makes. However, with appropriate bots running optimizations on top and harvesting pretty regularly the strategies, it'd be possible to increase the lending revenues of the protocol by up to 50%, thus further increasing SLP and veANGLE revenues.

Support Alchemix in launching a self-repaying OHM product (alOHM) by 1) providing them with $50k in liquidity incentivization support per quarter for a total of two quarters, and 2) adding 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity. Background. Alchemix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset protocol that gives users advances on various yield strategies via a synthetic token. The Alchemix loans are self-repaying, interest-free and non-liquidating. Today, Alchemix offers various strategies to borrow against select USD-pegged stablecoins (alUSD) and ETH (alETH) Alchemixs focus over the last months has been to expand cross-chain and to deploy new yield strategies for the existing alAssets. In parallel, the Alchemix and Olympus teams have also been exploring the creation of a new alAsset and to launch alOHM as the next product. This self-repaying OHM loan product has been frequently requested by both communities in the past, and with this proposal (and the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here) we offer both communities the opportunity to make this a reality. For Olympus, alOHM represents a novel use case that adds further utility to the token. Ohmies will be able to take out liquidation and interest free loans, enjoy similar Alchemix strategies for alOHM as for alUSD and alETH, as well as LP the alOHM/OHM pool. From the protocols perspective, it is invaluable for other protocols to build on top of the OHM monetary layer and so we want to support the (first) teams doing so. As a piece of background information, the feasibility of creating new alAssets for Alchemix depends on various factors, such as demand, a sustainable yield source, and a clear path towards profitability. The major expense for Alchemix to launch a new product is the creation and incentivization of a new liquidity pool for the synthetic asset. As such, this proposal focuses on support for bootstrapping alOHM liquidity that will make the product become sustainable over time (and able to operate independently without direct Olympus support after the bootstrapping period) alOHM details. The alOHM vault will launch with the following parameters: - Accepted collateral: OHM, gOHM. - Deposit cap: 1,000,000 OHM. - LTV%: 50% At launch, it will have a single yield strategy which uses the OHM ARR for the self-repaying loan. In the future, if additional yield sources are available that Alchemix supports, these could potentially be added as well. In terms of an alOHM/OHM liquidity pool, both teams have agreed that Balancer is the preferred choice. Not only would alOHM/OHM route directly into the existing OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pools, Balancer/Aura currently also offers a more favourable incentivization/bribe multiplier than competitors. For more details on the vault workings and specifications, please visit the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here: [link] Olympus support. In order to make this product feasible to deploy for Alchemix, and to help bootstrap the launch, Alchemix has requested Olympuss support for the following two things. First, Olympus would help co-incentivize the liquidity pool during the initial bootstrapping period. More specifically, this would be support in the form of $50k per quarter for a total of two (2) quarters. Alchemix will combine these funds with up to 500 ALCX/week to incentivize/bribe the pool in order to attract liquidity. Second, Olympus would deploy 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity at the start. These funds would be sourced from previously inverse-bonded OHM. By creating the LP token, Olympus would be earning trading fees as well as BAL/AURA rewards (assuming the gauge vote for the pool passes, and after staking the LP tokens) Note that for Alchemix the launch of alOHM is dependent on support during the bootstrapping period and that without it the product is likely not feasible to be deployed at this time.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOFZAHpqL2TEoR9NZ4ZNLZpiq7MU", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954069, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about supporting Alchemix in launching a new product called alOHM, which is a self-repaying loan using their synthetic asset token.

Current Process. The current process can be found[here]([link]), but here is a summary. Phase 1 (Discussion) & Phase 2 (1IP formalization) have an open-ended duration, so they have no specific deadline. Phase 3 (temperature check) lasts five days. Proposals stay unchanged in this phase. Phase 4 (Snapshot Vote) lasts seven days. Phase 5 (Implementation) lasts a minimum of six days - This can be ignored since it does not involve the community. This means that the current governance process (ignoring phase 5) totals a minimum of 12 days to pass a proposal. Amendments. We recommend the following amendments: - Phase 3 - Reduce from five days to three days. - Phase 4 - Reduce from seven days to five days. These changes ensure enough time to cast a forum and snapshot vote without compromising security. Across other DAOs, having a Snapshot vote last around five days is common practice. It provides a grey area between 3 days (too short) and 7 days (too long) New Process. - Phase 1 & Phase 2 - Open-ended. - Phase 3 - Lasts three days. - Phase 4 - Lasts five days. - Phase 5 - Lasts seven days.

Discussion: [link] Short description: Upgrade wETH interest rate on Ethereum v2 to match Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. author: @Llamaxyz - Defi_Consulting. dated: 2023-01-29. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Following on from the forum discussion relating to wETH and wstETH interest rates across Ethereum v2 and v3, this Snapshot will focus on implementing the wETH interest rate parameter changes on Aave v2. Since the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. This proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend. Motivation. Since AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch) The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aaves wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below. !([link]]) The market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below: Structured products charge a fee Additional smart contract risk Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity. Our analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed. This proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1% The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1) Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. The graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves. !([link]]) The graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed. !([link]]) It is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95% Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced. The chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve. !([link]]) Specification.

Over the past 6 months, the relationship between Flywheel and Frax has done nothing but blossom and has played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative about Frax. The Frax Core Team have proven themselves to be the most talented builders in all of DeFi, shipping a plethora of primitives over the past year. But before Flywheel existed, Frax did not have an effective strategy for promoting their brand or educating the wider public. As the old mantra goes, if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? It was clear that the Frax ecosystem needed assistance on that front and that help was not going to come from anywhere else but the community. [You can read more about Flywheel and its performance over the last grant period in the original post in [Frax Governance forum.]([link])] Proposed Grant and Budget Breakdown. Total Cost: $214.2k. - Half of the grant will be streamed via llamapay and half the grant will be granted lump sum at the end of the year. - Of what is streamed via llamapay it will be 80% FXS and 20% FRAX. Of the lump sum it will be 80% FRAX and 20% FXS.

Extra Note. - Section in 2024 grant proposal about the progress of independent income streams of Flywheel. Team. And just like last time, the people who are leading this initiative are: Sam McCulloch long-time member of the Frax community. Executive producer of all content, co-host of Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website. DeFi Dave Day Zero Fraximalist. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website. kapital_k ([0xkapital_k]([link])) DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and early Frax supporter. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check. Motivation. Flywheel has firmly established its role in the ecosystem as the destination for information and alpha regarding Frax. As an organic development, Flywheel essentially fills the role of a marketing department and due to its quality and reach is able to reach the target audience Frax is looking for. Yet like any department, Flywheel still needs funds to keep the lights on in order to continue pushing content out as well as interact with the wider community in a thoughtful and genuine manner. We hope with this round of funding we will be able to keep performing our duty as stewards of the Frax ecosystem and spreading Frax far and wide as it enters the next stage of its development. From the motivation section of our last proposal, there are still several points that ring true. Flywheel still aims to be the \"Bankless of Frax and take the wheel in driving the narrative for Frax and Foundational Deep DeFi forward. There is simply just too much at stake to do nothing and merely \"hope for the best, we need to keep actively engaging the wider DeFi community and beyond in order to inform, educate, and entertain them about Frax and its surrounding ecosystem. We strongly believe that Frax will reach Ethereum-level in size and along the way, Frax can not only scale technologically on-chain, but must scale socially off-chain as well. Flywheel has done an excellent job representing Frax so far and we are here to keep pushing the momentum forward. As mentioned in the last two proposals, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than the core team alone and numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that have helped advance the protocol into the future. Flywheel is here to organize and shine a light on Frax, carrying the Fraximalist torch up high for those who seek it.

Stargate has been approached by PancakeSwap requesting that it move $2m of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to PancakeSwap on Ethereum.

Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @dydymoon @scottincrypto. Dated: 2023-01-11. --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to update the CRV interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3, and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools. Abstract. The CRV Supply Cap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 7.18% with a Utilization of 44.48% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1] This proposal intends to increase the CRV Supply Cap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves. Capital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, doubling the interest rate at the Uoptimal point, and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the Reserves. Motivation. With the CRV Reserve on Polygon reaching its Supply Cap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the Supply Cap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand. Llama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 80% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves. ![|602x313]([link]) ![|602x251]([link]) Specific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will lead to an increase in the Borrow Cap, which is a function of the Supply Cap and Uoptimal parameter. Borrow Cap = Supply Cap (Uoptimal + 0.1) The new Supply Cap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 1,012.72, [2] With borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments. ![|602x220]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 44,48% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14%, which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time. In addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at >0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a CRV interest rate equivalent to the BAL interest rate curve (which has a base 3%, slope 1 = 14%, and slope 2 = 150%) The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. ![|602x369]([link]) The Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments. Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.

These changes are expected to attract more borrowers and reduce the amount of free CRV.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nHello, This is a vote to deploy a new decentralized Angle stablecoin pegged to one ounce of gold, and to choose with which implementation this stablecoin should be made: - immutable contracts. - same flexibility and setup as agEUR. Context. Angle started in November 2021 as a decentralized stablecoin protocol by launching agEUR. It quickly became the largest decentralized euro stablecoin, and the most traded EUR stablecoin altogether. The protocol was designed from scratch to be able to launch different stablecoins. Angle is now at a phase where it is ready to welcome a gold pegged stablecoin alongside agEUR. Argument 1: The gold market is a great opportunity, both on-chain and off-chain PAXG & XAUt, the two biggest gold stablecoins, represent a close to $1B market for gold on-chain. Off-chain, gold is a ~$12T market. These two numbers represent both a great opportunity for gold stablecoins, and a acknowledgement that there is some demand for it on-chain. As a comparison, the total euro supply (M2) was around 15T in November 2022 (source:[ecb]([link])) for an on-chain euro market of $250M (source:[Euro-stablecoins dashboard]([link])by SebVentures) Argument 2: There is no decentralized gold stablecoin yet One of the most prominent argument for an Angle Gold stablecoin might simply be that there isnodecentralized gold stablecoin on-chain yet.This offers an interesting opportunity for Angle to lead DeFi forward. Argument 3: It creates a great opportunity to expand Angle to something bigger than a Euro-only protocol Looking beyond this proposal, the addition of a new stablecoin to Angle allows the protocol to move from the \"Euro decentralized stablecoin protocol corner to the \"DeFi products and infrastructure provider one. From a marketing standpoint, a truly decentralized gold stablecoin can therefore be quite positive for the protocol. Design. A debt-based gold stablecoin. Angle has two ways of issuing stablecoins: the original[Core module]([link]), and the more recent[Borrowing module]([link]) Though the Core module brings a lot of value, it relies on a complex equilibrium to be sustainable. On the other hand, the Borrowing module has a different value proposition (stablecoins are minted as debt collateralized by crypto deposits), but requires much less maintenance. It would hence be more efficient for the Angle Protocol to launch a gold stablecoin with the Borrowing module: where people would deposit crypto assets to borrow up to a certain quantity of Angles gold stablecoin. The question if this stablecoin had to be launched is therefore which implementation to use. Different implementation choices. On the one hand, the protocol could keep the same setup and flexibility as with agEUR, with upgradeable contracts, and the possibility to do direct deposit modules on protocols like Curve. On the other hand, to further extend the narrative of a decentralized permissionless gold, it'd be easy to deploy the stablecoin with fully immutable contracts, and only uncensorable assets as collateral (like ETH or LUSD) In all cases, contracts would rely on an audited infrastructure and use Chainlink oracles. Option 1: Immutable contracts. In this setup, the protocol would deploy a slightly revised version of the agToken and VaultManagers implementations to reduce the impact a wrongful governance could have on the stablecoin. While there would still be some parameters that can be updated by governance, like the debt ceiling or the possibility to add new collateral assets, most of the parameters would be immutable, and contracts would not be upgradeable. In particular, it would be impossible for governance to add new minters that are not specific'VaultManager'contracts, and the governance will not be able to engage into AMOs with Angle gold stablecoin or mint it through other means than borrowing. Governance will not be able to pause contracts or to add repayment fees. Pros: - Absolutely no counterparty risk or exposure to another gold stablecoin. - Real decentralized use case to push, like RAI or Liquity (even though in this case I'd still be possible to add new collateral assets), and the marketing impact + narrative it creates for the protocol is not to neglect. - Its a guarantee that it won't take too much development time to protocol contributors once its launched since its going to be hard if not impossible to change the protocol. Cons: - Based solely on the proposed CDP model, Angle Gold stablecoin peg would be a soft peg with respect to gold. While statistical arbitrageurs may come to the protocol, there will be no direct incentive to bring the gold stablecoin back to peg (a bit like Liquity today which trades 2/3% over peg) - There will probably be more frictions immediately when launching the stablecoin to grow liquidity for it as there will be no means for the protocol to directly mint on Curve or on Uniswap for instance. And over the long term, protocol would not have the full flexibility to expand this Angle Gold stablecoin by taking advantage of one power of decentralized stablecoins: direct deposit modules to for instance bootstrap liquidity in lending protocols (like Aave) Option 2: Same flexibility as with agEUR. This means that contracts for Angle Gold stablecoin would be the same as for agEUR, in the sense that they would be upgradeable, and it'd be possible to add new minters to the contracts. This could make it easy for instance to do direct deposit modules with the protocol, like governance could vote to enable the protocol to mint agGOLD in a Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD hence stabilizing agGOLD price. Pros: - Possibility to add a form of price stability module on Curve for the stablecoin hence improving the stablecoins peg. - if it ever takes off, then governance would have the means to engage in AMOs, and the protocol would be flexible enough to take any action that maintains the flywheel for the product. - It'd probably be more coherent in terms of the Angle Protocol brand if all stablecoins work roughly the same way, otherwise we'd have to be clear on the fact that agGOLD is more decentralized than agEUR which could create confusion. Cons: - Still a decentralized stablecoin governed by the Angle governance, but there is a significant risk in this setup that agGOLD ends up being backed by a majority of PAXG (through Curve deposit modules) which would increase the counterparty risk of the stablecoin. - Mutability means there could be more incentives to spend time amending it/developing the protocol even if gold may not be the highest ROI thing the protocol should focus on. Growth. In terms of growth, the perspectives are the same for both of the implementations. The main use cases for Angles gold stablecoin should be for holding gold on-chain in a permissionless way, and to trade gold against other crypto assets. Beyond that, borrowing the gold stablecoin from Angle could be used by traders to short Gold against the vault collateral. The first step for growing it will be to create a Curve pool with PAXG and push to have a gauge, and a Uniswap V3 pool with agEUR to have access to all of agEURs liquidity. With time, PAXG and XAUt holders looking for a more trustless alternative should progressively move towards Angles gold decentralized stablecoin. Cost. The only upfront cost for an Angle Gold stablecoin is the deployment cost (estimated around $1k) The development time (around 2 weeks) is also a factor to have in mind. Maintenance cost should be null as well (assuming no oracle cost), as the borrowing module can turn with no external intervention. The only added cost from oracles would be that we'll potentially have to pay for the XAU/USD oracle from Chainlink, but this is the same when adding any new collateral asset for the Borrowing module. Main costs will be that of the incentives for the gauges we make: agEUR-agGOLD, this is something which should be voted by veANGLE holders, but it won't result in extra incentives, so just an opportunity cost. There is no budget planned for Curve incentives, we could specify in a future proposal using a portion of the Curve bribe budget to bribe agGOLD-PAXG (diverted from agEUR-EUROC) There will be potentially a seeding cost for pools to be addressed in a subsequent proposal once the result of this vote (and the implementation chosen) is known. Risks. The main risk for the protocol is that it accumulates bad debt due to a failure in liquidations of vaults having issued the gold stablecoin. Keeper infrastructure to liquidate the stablecoin vault will work like for agEUR. Other than that, there is the reputation risk that the stablecoin doesn't maintain its peg. Though this would be negative, there would be no direct consequence for agEUR or other working parts of the protocol itself outside damaging the reputation. Voting Options. 1. For, deploy with immutable contracts. 2. For, deploy with same flexibility as agEUR. 3. Against, do nothing.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOFXyCOfskihQYLksfoFqOod4p5l", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954067, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests deploying a new decentralized stablecoin called Angle Gold, which will be pegged to one ounce of gold.

Dismantle specific positions on the current multisigs on Mainnet, Polygon, and Arbitrum (as outlined in the Execution Details section); 2. Bridge specific in-scope assets from Polygon and Arbitrum back to Mainnet (as outlined in the Execution Details section); 3. Transfer all in-scope assets (totaling approximately $5,900,000 as of the day of this writing) to a new SAFE provided by Karpatkey and owned by the Balancer DAO (as outlined in the Next Steps and Execution Details sections) Motivation. After internal discussion, the Karpatkey team has determined that the Balancer DAO would be best served by a simpler and more direct approach. Since Karpatkey has already been voted in as the treasury manager, there is no longer a need for further discussion or a new vote on the specific allocation of funds, despite having recently proposed the \"Base vs Expanded allocation\" approach. To streamline deployment, Karpatkey proposes beginning with the base allocation and then expanding as needed. This approach takes advantage of the Zodiac Roles Modifier permissions preset that has already been created and tested for allowlisting specific functions and protocols related to the base allocation. Karpatkey intends to move forward with this approach and will propose future adjustments in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the original proposal. However, any future adjustments to the strategy, and thus the preset, will ultimately require the approval of the Balancer DAO through the execution of a batch of transactions to apply the adjusted preset. Zodiac Roles Modifier preset to be applied. The original post proposed the following: [quote=\"karpatkey, post:1, topic:4220\"] Base allocation. If this proposal was selected, specific functions within the protocols below would be whitelisted. More technical details regarding the whitelisting process will be provided shortly. Staking: Lido. Stakewise Lending: Compound v2. Aave v2 AMM: Uniswap v3. [/quote] To increase flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions, Karpatkey suggests expanding protocols and functions to include ETH wrappers and unwrappers, swaps on Balancer and Uniswap v3. These swaps, except for regularly swapped reward tokens, are intended to provide Karpatkey with the ability to take immediate action in specific market conditions, such as a stablecoin losing its peg. The pools were chosen based on liquidity to maximize results for the Balancer DAO, but new permissions may be necessary as market conditions change. The Manager preset consists of the complete list of permissions that Karpatkey asks the Balancer DAO to grant. This list can be found in this [Annex Document]([link]) Through the Zodiac Role Modifier, the Manager preset will be applied to the Manager Role, which in turn will be assigned to Karpatkeys Manager SAFE. Future permissions and roles. Once the initial strategy is deployed, there will be a periodic need to adapt the portfolio to changing market conditions. If a particular strategy no longer provides sufficient yield, or if a particular pool in which the Balancer DAO has a position becomes deprecated and needs to be migrated, new permissions will be required. In addition, creating new roles to improve or expand operations will also be necessary. Two new roles are planned for the near future: the Harvester Role and the Swapper Role. Both roles will be granted specific subsets of the Manager preset permissions and will be assigned to EOAs to automate certain tasks. The Harvester Role will be allowed to claim rewards, while the Swapper Role will be allowed to swap these rewards for ETH or stablecoins. When deemed appropriate, Karpatkey will create a new forum post requesting the Balancer DAO to update the preset or deploy new roles. The post will include an explanation of why the permissions and/or roles are needed and the executable payload. The proposal will need to be passed by the community and, once approved, it will be executed by the multisig according to the DAO standard operating practices. It is important that this process is as simple and straightforward as possible, since every day of waiting may represent an opportunity cost to the DAOs treasury. A summary of the new permissions and/or roles will be included as a separate section in every corresponding weekly report. Next steps. The next steps for implementing this proposal are as follows: 1. Karpatkey will create a new SAFE, deploy the Roles Modifier contract, and apply the Manager Role preset (as outlined in the Annex Document) to simplify the process for the Balancer DAO. 2. Karpatkey will conduct a small-scale replication of the strategy for a second round of testing. 3. Once the SAFE is created, tested, and permissions are applied, Karpatkey will transfer ownership of it to the Balancer DAO and remove themselves as owner. 4. This proposal will be submitted to Snapshot for approval. 5. If the proposal is approved, the Balancer DAO will execute the steps described in the Execution Details section. Execution details. The following list is intended to serve as a clear execution roadmap for the Balancer DAO once (if) this proposal is approved: 1. Dismantle the Balancer Boosted AAVE USD position on Mainnet and withdraw 100% of the funds in DAI. 2. Dismantle WBTC + ETH position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion. 3. Dismantle ETH + GTC position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion. 4. Dismantle MATIC + USDC + WETH + BAL position on Polygon and withdraw the four assets in equal proportion. 5. Bridge USDC and WETH from Polygon back to Mainnet. 6.

The goal of this proposal is to address the capital inefficiency issue associated with providing liquidity, as ankrETH generates a yield from staking rewards while the other half of the ETH provided does not. By utilizing BAL incentives and swap fees, this proposal aims to mitigate the capital inefficiency effect and stimulate volume on Balancer.

TL;DR: This BIP focuses around the process by which BIPs move from the Forum to Snapshot, and how approved snapshots are implemented on-chain. First and foremost, if passed, it provides a single place with a consolidated statement of the current governance process (see Specification) In doing so it: - Disbands the Gov Council and allows any address with over 200,000 veBAL in delegation to post a snapshot. - Sets more clear rules for what makes something fit for governance, and how snapshots must be posted. - Clearly lays out the process for validating and implementing approved governance matters, and who is responsible for conducting said process. Motivation. The motivations of this BIP are 2-fold: 1. Increase decentralization in Balancer governance. 2. Create more separation of concern between the governance decision making process and the risk-aware implementation of decided proposals. Background: Decision Making: [The Governance Process Revamp]([link]) originally appointed a governance council with the mandate to ensuring \"soft community consensus before bringing a proposal to snapshot. In February 2022, [Governance Process Revamp 2.0]([link]) proposed that \"soft-consensus was too subjective of a measurement, giving the council too much power vs veBAL Voters. It moved the councils mandate to ensuring that a proposal was \"well-defined in that it: - Includes Motivation, Specification, and Risk sections. - Includes an exact specification of any on-chain calls that need to be made, which include exact details of the calls to be run in english with required addresses and calls. - Communicates clear and specific intent (not spam) - Follows the rules set forth by and does not conflict with outstanding governance proposals. In an effort to further decentralize, and with significant precedent for \"well-defined in place, it is unclear why a specific council is required to assert these things before bringing an item to snapshot. Further, there have been some murmurings in recent governance discussions of the Gov Council using their power to steer the governance process towards a specific outcome. In the end, governance exists to enact the will of veBAL holders. Large governance participants and/or delegates seem to have sufficient vested interest in the protocol to treat the governance process with respect and not spam governance with incomplete and/or deceptive proposals. Proposal Implementation: The [Balancer Maxis]([link]) are responsible for facilitating the on-chain implementation of governance and operation of the protocol. In doing so, they currently must translate the specification of each governance topic into a a specific set of instructions (taking form of a Gnosis Safe Transaction Builder JSON file), validate that it does not create unreasonable risk for the protocol, load it into the safe, and coordinate with the respective signers to execute. The Maxis and the Governance Council currently have the overlapping membership, so the process of ensuring that the specification is clear enough to generate such a JSON naturally occurs during the forum discussion. The specification often needs to be changed by the original proposer accordingly or needs change by the Maxis to ensure that exact implementation to spec is possible. Specification. ![[image]]([link]) Proposal Requirements: The following, posted to either the [General Proposals]([link]) or the [BAL Gauges]([link]) section of the Balancer Forum, is required for a proposal to go to snapshot: - Includes Motivation Section: What is the reason for this, why is it good for the veBAL ecosystem? - Includes English Specification: Clearly state exactly what this proposal will change and the effects it will have on the operation of the protocol or balance of the treasury. - Includes multisig transaction payload: A compete [Gnosis Safe Transaction Builder JSON]([link]) The Balancer Maxis can show you how to build this or put it together for you if you need help. - Includes Risks: What risks does this pose to the protocol? - For Spend (how does it affect runway) - For Gauge Votes (consider pool makeup and caps as per the [Gauge Framework]([link]) and/or community discussion) - For other changes explain any and all risks clearly. Further, votes requesting new gauges should include the following information: - What are the initial fees set to, and what is the reasoning for this? - If stableswap, How is the A-factor set and why was the given a-factor chosen? - If custom pool, How does this pool generate revenue? Is 50% of the revenue generated sent to the fees collector? Where can details about the performance of this pool be found? Where can users deposit into it and trade through it? Submitting the Transaction Payload File(s) to github: A PR must be created to the [BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops]([link]) repository on Github. Instructions and examples for how to build various transaction payloads and upload it to Github can be found [HERE]([link]) If not using examples. Here is a clearer spec: - BIPs that require transactions against a single multisig should have their payload file uploaded named like 'BIP-XXX.json' or 'BIP-XXX.csv' directly into the '/BIPs' folder of this repo. - BIPs that require transactions against multiple multisigs should have a directory named 'BIP-XXX' with files for each multisig placed in this directory. Files should be named like '[chain]-[multisig][extention]' where chain is like 'mainnet, arbi, polygon, etc' and multisig is like 'dao, gauge, fees, etc' Posting the Proposal to Snapshot: Any address with over 200,000 veBAL held or in delegation may create a new snapshot vote directly on the snapshot forum. With great power comes great responsibility. Snapshot posters are expected to ensure the following: - The Snapshot body should begin with a link to the transaction payload PR on github. Followed by the full text of the BIP. If the text is too long, it can be truncated. - Note that if the proposal requires no on-chain actions to be executed, the payload is not required. - A link to the forum discussion should be included in the discussion (optional) field of Snapshot. - The BIP is titled like BIP-[XXX] Title from Forum, where XXX is the next number in the BIP sequence. - The Original Forum Poster should update their post to match the title from the snapshot and include a link to it at the bottom of the body of the Forum Post. - Barring clear community consensus otherwise the vote Should be of Type \"Basic Voting and the choices should be one of [Yes, lets do it - No, This is not the way - Abstain] - Runs for 96 hours starting on a Thursday (GMT) - Has a quorum of 2 million veBAL. NOTE: The technical process of defining and applying governance on-chain is likely to shift over time. A pull request of verifiable code to the Github repo listed below shall be considered the formal way to submit a payload. Details on additional types of payloads (other than transaction builder JSONs and airdrop CSVs) may be added. The main [README]([link]) for this repo will be kept up to date with information and specifications about how to create and submit payloads. Execution of Proposals approved by governance: If the BIP passes, the Balancer Maxis will make every effort to confirm that the payload and the English definitions match, load the specified payloads into the appropriate multisig, and coordinate with signers for execution. Following execution. The Maxis will comment on the forum post for the proposal and include a link to any transactions relevant to execution at the bottom of the body. The Maxis may send the proposal back to the proposer for revision and a new snapshot (with the same BIP number) for the following reasons: - The Payload does not match the english specification. - The Payload is not in a recognisable/verifiable form by the Maxis. - Tx Builder JSON files and airdrop CSVs are always ok. - The Payload does simulate successfully in tenderly and/or produce the desired results on fork. - In this case the Maxis will help to fix the payload and facilitate a revote to approve. - The snapshot did not conform the the guidelines defined directly above. - Start/End Time. - Quorum. - Necessary Content. The Gov Council therefore has no remaining purpose and is dissolved. Technical Specification: If this vote passes, the proposal validation setting in the [balancer snapshot space settings]([link]) should be configured to match the following. Note that we are currently working with snapshot to add the ability to restrict voting to be started on a specific day of the week. If more options become available to better validate inputs against the policies stand here before posting a snapshot, they may be applied without further governance: ![[image]]([link]) Community Conversation, Revision and Alpha Testing: Over the next week or two, as the community discusses this change the text of this BIP may be adapted. Additionally, I will work to build set of resources that explain the basics of how Balancer On-chain Governance works and provides template proposals and JSON files for various types of commonly requested governance. I will post links to these resources as links in this section of the Forum Post as they become available. It would be very helpful to work with some Governance Proposers on to demonstrate the new BIP format in upcoming governance.

Pendle Finance, with support from Aura contributors. Summary. Pendle is proposing to enable a Balancer gauge for a PENDLE-ETH pool on mainnet with a 2% emissions cap. Protocol Description. The Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via the custom V2 AMM. This brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. PT is the equivalent of [zero-coupon bonds]([link]) while YT is the equivalent of [coupon payments]([link]) By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as: Long assets at a discount Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral A mix of any of the above strategies. Utility. PENDLE is the platform token of the Pendle protocol and is the cornerstone of value accrual mechanics and management. It also functions as the governance token, by staking and locking into vePENDLE. With vePENDLE, an array of new features are unlocked for PENDLE holders, increasing the tokens utility. The Pendle protocol collects a 3% fee from all yield accrued by yield tokens (YT) and 80% of the swap fees(0.1% of the trade at a 1 year maturity) in the V2 AMM. Currently, 100% of this fee is distributed to vePENDLE holders, while the contributors collect no revenue. This is subject to change in the future. A portion of the yield from matured unredeemed PTs will be distributed pro rata to vePENDLE holders as well. If you LP in a pool while you are holding vePENDLE, your PENDLE incentives and rewards for all of your LPs will be further boosted as well, by up to 2.5x based on your vePENDLE value. The Pendle protocol is currently deployed on Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of deploying the protocol on other EVM chains. Recently, Pendle launched a v2 AMM which made several improvements to the protocol: increased capital efficiency with more LP revenue sources and trading, specialized yield trading with concentrated liquidity and optimized fee rate, and minimal impermanent loss with no value leakage from arbitrage. In addition, with the v2 launch, the protocol is now fully permissionless wherein anyone can list and create a market for any yield-bearing asset. PENDLE distribution. As of October 2022: 10% Incentives 19.2% Ecosystem Fund 5.7% Team (Vested) 65.1% Circulating Total: 235,890,444 PENDLE. Team tokens vest up to April 2023. Beyond this, any increase in circulating supply will be contributed by incentives and ecosystem building. Emissions as of Oct 2022 are 667,705 PENDLE per week, with a 1.1% decrease each week until April 2026. At this point, the current tokenomics allow for a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum for incentives. ![[image]]([link]) As the industry matures, governance may propose changes based on the evolution of ecosystem best practices. ![[image]]([link]) Motivation. Pendle currently has ~$545.08K on Sushi and ~199.3K on Kyber in trading volume over the last 30 days. Most of the current PENDLE liquidity resides in the form of a PENDLE-wETH pool with liquidity currently valued at $873.5K. Pendle Finance would like to deepen the liquidity for the PENDLE token on Ethereum to support low slippage transactions. Furthermore, Pendle intends to provide voting incentives to the pool via Hidden Hand, namely through the vlAURA market. Pendle is aiming at incentivizing votes with approximately $8,000 worth of PENDLE per vlAURA voting cycle (every two weeks) Lastly, Pendle would like to be a part of the continued growth that Balancer has been experiencing and to capture the upside of what is to come to the Balancer DEX (e.g. technology, partnerships, integrations) Specifications Governance: Pendles governance is powered by Vote-Escrowed PENDLE, or vePENDLE. vePENDLE enables protocol governance by allowing PENDLE holders to channel protocol incentives to desired pools. Oracles: The PENDLE token does not use any oracles. Audits: The Pendle codebase has been fully audited by reputable auditors, including some of the top wardens from C4, and all flaws have been addressed. Nonetheless, users are advised to exercise caution and deploy funds prudently. [link] Centralization Vectors: The core protocol is designed to be decentralized and permissionless. Protocol assets are only accessible by the users and not by any other entities. There is a governance role (currently a multisig) that could set the protocol fees, which have a hard cap set in smart contracts. The PENDLE token is not upgradeable, pausable, and does not have any blacklisting capabilities. Market History: PENDLE has been live since April 2021 on Ethereum. Sushi Pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Kyber Pool: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Value: Upon approval, this gauge will be the primary liquidity pool for PENDLE on Ethereum and drive value to Balancer through trading volume and rewards via bribes.

Dennis. Nader Ghazvini. Sam Kazemian. Summary. This proposal aims to describe the frxETHBP and WETHR program and authorize an allocation of incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs, DAOs, and protocols with an underlying token of frxETH. Background and Motivation. Frax Ether is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smooth the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH. In just 85 days, frxETH has gone from 0 to 50k in supply, which was an essential milestone for Frax and highlighted the success of its design. But it also shows that Frax Finance has a great product that can be quickly adopted by the mass market. However, as we look to the future, its essential to focus on creating deep liquidity for frxETH. This will improve the trading experience for current holders, make it more attractive for new users to enter the market, and drive further adoption. The WETHR (WETH Replacement) program is an incentive system made to make frxETH a viable alternative to WETH in smart contracts after Shanghai withdrawals are live. Proposal Details. We propose allocating a budget for incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs with underlying tokens of frxETH. sfrxETH in liquidity pools or protocols is not eligible for this program. sfrxETH can receive their own independent incentives through the gauge system. The frxETH incentives include, but are not limited to, the following actions: Bribing Gauge votes Vote with protocol voting power. The Frax core team will spend it for frxETH liquidity proportional to the number of tokens in the liquidity pools, and using incentives will be AMM agnostic so that they can be used for any AMM platforms such as Curve, Fraxswap, etc. Budget: The budget for this proposal will be the farming rewards from frxETH and sfrxETH pools held by the frxETH Treasury and a maximum of $2.4 million worth of FXS from the bi-weekly Votium budget ([FIP]([link])) that can be spent for any AMM platform.

The $SPHERE token symbolizes the governance held by the treasury. Our focus is on developing protocols and solutions, making investments, and creating benefits for those who hold our token. Motivation: > The purpose of this proposal is to incorporate a veBAL gauge into the SPHERE/WMATIC 80/20 weighted pool in order to enhance liquidity through BAL incentives. Upon being approved, we plan to participate in the Balancer Wars and offer incentives to $veBAL holders to increase liquidity for our token. We have recently moved our liquidity to Balancer and have observed a significant volume of over $200,000 on the first day. Our goal is to encourage more volume for our token, ultimately contributing to the overall volume of Balancer Specifications: 1. Governance: Our funds are held on a 4/8 multisig. All individuals are doxxed internally as well as to third parties to ensure safety of liquidity. Multisig holders are elected members by the community, publicly doxxed members and team members that are doxxed to afromentioned public entities. 2. Oracles: None. 3. Audits: We've had a public peer review of our contract by our developers of our community, as well as, additional audits (can be found in the docs) 4. Centralization vectors: Two functions within the protocol: RescueToken and ClearStuckBalance, each to withdraw tokens from the $SPHERE token contract. The token implementation can be upgraded upon multisig agreement and a 48 hour timelock. 5. Market History: We have launched as a rebasing token back in March of 2022 and have since pivoted into a deflationary token, with real yield being shared towards our holders. 6. Value: Our conviction is that 80/20 ve tokenomics provide a superior solution compared to any other ve token approach, and we are eager to implement this solution on Balancer, with the goal of providing value to both parties.

Summary Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs. In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote. Background CLever is a risk-minimized lending platform for high quality tokens such as CVX and FRAX. CLever loans are denominated in clevTokens, which are assets paired to their specific collateral and representing its future yield. clevTokens are treated as equivalent to their respective collateral by the system, so they carry no risk of liquidation and no exposure to price oracles. CLever does not charge interest on loans, but instead a fixed rate on yield harvests, which means borrowing costs do not change with any pool utilization or liquidity. CLever FRAX allows users to mint clevUSD against several Frax-based stablecoin collateral strategies, each with its own maximum LTV and independent yield. For CLever FRAX, all yields are swapped into FRAX, which is used to pay down their clevUSD system debt 1:1, then distributed via a stability mechanism called the Furnace. In order for borrowers to utilize their borrowed tokens, CLever provides incentivized swap pools pairing each clevToken with its associated collateral. Sufficient liquidity in these pools facilitates swapping with reasonable slippage, and incentives create a yield farming opportunity for LPs of liquid FRAX with a unique risk profile. Since clevTokens represent future yield rather than a pegged asset (see next section) LP pairs are correlated, limiting the scope of impermanent loss to LPs and making these farms unique in the market. clevTokens are not wrappers of their underlying collateral tokens. Instead they represent future yield generated by collateral strategies, denominated in the collateral tokens. clevTokens can only be minted against their associated collateral, and only up to the maximum LTV for each given strategy (currently 30-50% for FRAX) During bootstrapping CLever also imposes an overall borrowing limit for each strategy. These limits will be raised as liquidity grows. clevTokens can eventually all be exchanged for corresponding real collateral tokens at 1:1 via the Furnace, so they can be considered a zero coupon bond with indefinite maturity. If the furnace currently holds collateral tokens the swap is immediate, but users can deposit clevTokens to the Furnace even if there are no collateral tokens currently available. In this case, users share the upcoming harvests proportionally with any other Furnace depositors. New harvests to the Furnace are released linearly over 1-2 weeks (depending on the collateral) which creates a smooth continuous burn rate/bond repayment and prevents timing exploits when the system is oversubscribed. The time required to convert clevTokens into their real underlying asset via the Furnace is determined by the collateral yield rate(s), as well as how many clevTokens are sharing those harvests in the Furnace. Since clevTokens represent future assets rather than current ones, they can trade at a discount representing the time value of those tokens like any bond. Borrowers swap when the discount is sufficiently small and, on the other side of the equation, users can buy clevTokens from the Curve pool to arbitrage the discount. This arbitrage can be repeatedly looped between the Furnace and the Curve pool as the Furnace converts clevTokens to their paired collateral assets. CLEV Tokenomics CLEV is CLevers native token and it uses Curves ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. CLever applies fees to the collateral token harvest yield, the majority of which will be distributed to veCLEV holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because CLEV is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue in CVX, FRAX, and any future collateral tokens. The operation of CLever makes it a net buyer of CVX and FRAX. Locking CLEV is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn a growing stable of hodl-worthy tokens. Motivation: Increasing liquidity and visibility for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool is critical to the operation of CLever. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways: - CLevers model directly supports demand for underlying collateral strategies like FRAXBP farms by facilitating the creation of leveraged farming positions. - CLever provides unique new farming opportunities and by creation of yield bond markets and (liquid) clevToken-collateral farming. Proposal In order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support clveUSD - Frax swaps we propose that Frax vote with 300,000 vlCVX for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool for the next 6 epochs on Votium. In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote. - For: Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs. - Against: Do nothing\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOFq2HKtFZyYl3ZHZfbT10HFU5NY", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954086, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests allocating 300,000 vlCVX votes for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool for the next 6 epochs, in exchange for Frax receiving 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months.

Discussion: [link] short description: Add wstETH to Optimism Aave v3 deployment as collateral with borrowing enabled. Create an Ethereum eMode. author: Llama - Defi_Consulting. dated: 2023-01-29. --- Summary. This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Optimism V3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Across the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Optimism Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled. The stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aaves revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Optimism users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave. The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers. Motivation. The stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.55B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.83B) and ETH ($1.42B) This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. Demand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Optimism Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Optimism. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aaves revenue. The charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and has already generated $281k by late January. ![Screenshot]]([link]) Listing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Optimism, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Specification.

Protocol Description StaFi is a liquid staked derivatives protocol launched in Q3 2020, with a focus on bringing liquidity to staked assets on Ethereum and other Proof of Stake chains such as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Since launch, the protocol has accrued over $36,000,000 worth of staked assets across 11 tokens, with 3,439 active validators. Similar to other LSD protocols, StaFi issues a liquid receipt token (rETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissionless validator set. Deposits are partially covered by validator deposits. The exchange rate between rETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though rETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Shanghai upgrade. StaFi has a native governance token with the ticker \"FIS. FIS is freely tradable on a number of centralized exchanges, alongside some decentralized exchanges not inclusive of Balancer. FIS has governance utility and can be staked by validators in the StaFi consensus network. Motivation StaFi currently has an[existing rETH-ETH pool]([link]) on Curve that sees regular trades between both assets. StaFi is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its staked derivatives, starting with rETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Shanghai Ethereum hard fork, liquidity and yield on LSDs will be a key competing factor as LSD protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders. StaFi is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual. Specifications 1. Governance: [DAO forum]([link]) 2. Oracles: Direct Balance Query: The rETH rateProvider has a getRate function that calls rETHs own getExchangeRate function. See the [contract here]([link]) 3. Audits: [StaFi rToken App Audits]([link]) 4. Centralization Vectors:StaFis rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stoppingJust that the bridge would run less efficiently. 5. Market History: rETH has been a tradable asset since March 2021. Trading has primarily taken place in the aforementioned rETH-ETH pool on Curve. FIS is a liquid asset traded both on top centralized exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges. 6. Value: StaFi will make its Balancer rETH-ETH pool a primary source of liquidity for rETH on Ethereum mainnet. By bolstering liquidity of the pool, Balancer should gain from increased trading fees.

Email: . Telegram: @DAOstrat. ' Intro. gm Hop community! Cameron here on behalf of ConsenSys. We are proud to engage with such an active community. Most people know ConsenSys for Metamask, Infura, and Truffle, but we're here to talk about something else: a zkEVM Rollup. We recently launched the [Testnet]([link]) (open only for allowlist users) and are reaching out to propose deploying Hop for the ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet and subsequent Mainnet. ConsenSys follows the progression of the Hop ecosystem closely and even recently integrated Hop into our [bridging aggregator]([link]) Hop is a unique and critical piece of infrastructure that seamlessly bridges assets between chains. Proposal Details. Proposal. This proposal asks the Hop community to support bridging using the protocol between the ConsenSys zkEVM and other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Specifically, this will integrate various protocol features with the trustless ConsenSys zkEVM token bridge. This will help provide sufficient bridging liquidity for future Testnet users. (330K signups as of today) ConsenSys team members are in contact with Authereum (DBA Hop Labs) and are excited to work on this together. Motivation. What is particularly exciting about the ConsenSys zkEVM is that it is a type 2 zkEVM. As a result, it is EVM equivalent, meaning existing smart contracts, toolsets, and release processes can be easily deployed without substantial modifications. This means de minimis switching costs for dApp developers. During the Testnet phases and Mainnet, we expect a robust user base that will drive activity to the Hop protocol (and community) as demand for bridging increases. Also, the protocol will be the first to integrate with the native zkEVM bridge, which is a significant opportunity for the Hop ecosystem. Bridge Deployments. Bridges play a key role in Layer 2 Rollups; we look at it as one of the central pillars of the tech stack. Currently, we are running a native trustless messaging and token bridge used for ERC20s from Layer 1. In addition, as strong supporters of Hop, We forked the Hop frontend and adopted it for this first phase of the zkEVM Testnet. Bridges and related contracts are deployed and managed by the core protocol dev team with support from ConsenSys. Authereum is aware of the considerations and excited to work with us on the ConsenSys zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM. Type 2 zkEVM. The ConsenSys zkEVM handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper. Unlike other rollups, the Consensys zkEVM does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks. Timeline/Next Steps. The Request For Comment was posted in the Forums on January 19, 2023. The proposal is now posted in Snapshot. Once these steps are completed, we will team up with a Delegate to post the On-chain proposal. Conclusion. Consensys looks forward to strengthening our partnership with Hop through direct integrations. Supporting bridging to and from the ConsenSys zkEVM will allow for a seamless user experience and drive growth for the Hop ecosystem. We look forward to the discussion below!\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOFqcoS2Ukpj6iKhBl0W2OOfOQWV", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954086, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cameron O'Donnell from ConsenSys has proposed a partnership with the Hop community to deploy a zkEVM Rollup.

Background. Stargate faces a significant threat to its POL and to the security of token holders due to potential security issues within Alameda Research (Alameda) To ensure the safekeeping of Launch Auction Stargate tokens, the StargateDAO proposes to re-issue all Stargate tokens (STG) By re-issuing STG, StargateDAO would eliminate the risk of illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alamada wallets and would protect the interest of all token holders. As background, on March 17, 2022 Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from the Stargate Community sale. Alameda subsequently publicly committed to lockup all these tokens until March 2025 ([link]) Recent on-chain transfers from known Alameda wallets reveal that Alameda does not have full control of its wallets and that a malicious actor or hacker is misappropriating Alamedas funds ([link] [link] [link]) The consequence of a bad actor controlling Alamedas wallets and the potential harm to token holders and Stargate cannot be understated. Without a token re-issuance a malicious actor with access to Alamedas private keys could claim the Stargate tokens from the contract as they vest and misappropriate them as they seem to have with other funds. If such an actor were to claim and dump STG on the market, in violation of the three year lockup agreement, the following could occur. The actor would hypothetically claim the tokens as they vest to the wallets over a 6 month period for example. This would introduce 100,000,000 STG (10% of total supply) into the circulating supply over the next 6 months. This could be dumped into existing LP, draining stablecoins from POL as Stargate owns its own liquidity. We recognize that there may be ongoing discussions surrounding the 100M tokens as part of the Alameda bankruptcy process. As such, we propose the Stargate Foundation set aside these tokens in a separate wallet where they will remain untouched until there has been clarity or a court order from one or both parties. Proposal. Stargate will reissue STG on March 15th, 2023. This will result in a state where the current STG will no longer power Stargate while a new STG contract replaces it. Users would not have to do anything for this swap to happen. On March 15th, a snapshot would be taken of all user balances, and a new token will be sent to every user on a 1:1 basis. Doing this reissue will ensure that the 100,000,000 tokens (10% of total supply) Alameda acquired and then sold will not be stolen and sold onto the market, negatively impacting Stargate. The launch auction portion will be custodied in a designated mutisig wallet until further instructions are given by stakeholders. They will not be moved in any way absent such direction. Execution. Stargate should reissue STG on March 15, 2023 at a 1:1 basis for the existing STG token. Existing holders would have the new STG token airdropped to them (based on a snapshot taken the same day at a pre-announced time), including any unclaimed rewards earned in any farms at the snapshot date. Any unassigned tokens in any contracts would be returned to the Stargate DAO to ensure a clean transition. 24 hours prior to the snapshot all protocol owned LP would be removed from any on chain spots it exists within. All exchanges that currently support STG will be asked to pause deposit and withdrawals for the same 24 hour period. After the new token exists, the LP will be re-added with the new token as the pair, and all exchanges will be asked to resume deposits and withdrawals honoring the new token. All users with STG vested as veSTG and aaSTG will have their vests reissued where upon unlock, they will receive the new STG token. This will allow all users to maintain the same terms of their locks and voting rights associated with them. Finally, all farm contracts will be re-enabled with the new STG token as the reward given and users will be asked to deposit liquidity into the new contracts to resume farming STG and supporting Stargate. Success. Success is defined as STG V2 launching and replacing STG. Upon successful reissue, all functions of the STG token will be identical to STG. Summary. Stargate faces a material threat to POL and the security of token holders due to potential security issues within Alameda Research. A token swap to a new STG token is proposed with holders getting an identical token to their current supply and state for STG. A successful migration would prevent a potential catastrophic downside to the protocol while maintaining smooth function robust markets for STG.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOFrAHPAzoqsWAIIbOSIBPWzuhTS", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954087, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests that Stargate reissue a new token called STG and distribute it to all existing STG holders.

A migration of the development cluster from the Fox Foundation to under the DAOs control, via TaxiStake. The development cluster is necessary for addition of new nodes/chains, local and hosted development environments, upgrades, rolling out breaking changes with blue/green deployments etc. This is another progressive decentralization step, where the costs of the development cluster were hidden and previously absorbed by the Fox Foundation. Addition of archival nodes to the infrastructure. Within this budget cycle, this will allow us to remove reliance on Etherscan for internal transaction data required for balance and transaction history, and Infura for archival node data. Node snapshots of synced or syncing nodes - cloud storage costs are expensive. Additional EVM chains, namely Optimism - EVM nodes are expensive by virtue of storage and data. The following factors are expected to increase the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle: the addition of more EVM chains, namely Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, requiring archival node syncs, and multiple snapshots, and data ingress. The following factors are expected to decrease the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle: Negotiated lower margin with TaxiStake. Previously a 50% markup was applied to the underlying infrastructure costs, this has been reduced to 30% Removal of EVM full nodes (Ethereum/Avalanche/Optimism), once archival nodes are fully synced. Removal of outdated snapshot data for currently syncing nodes. Migration of API layer from 'eu-west-1' to 'us-east-1', reducing application layer costs by 50%, though this may not be worth the labor cost to enact. TaxiStake is currently forecasting a bottom line cost of $22,100 for February. The numerous factors above make an accurate forecast difficult. Overall, we are expecting a slight net increase in costs, and are requesting $120,000 USDC for expected infrastructure costs, based on an expected maximum $30,000 for four months. Failure to cover these costs will lead to a 100% production outage. Non-recurring costs. Bounty Program. As discussed and largely agreed within the community, the bounty program in its previous form had significant flaws. We are requesting $8,000/month worth of FOX, ~200,000 FOX at current prices, to provision for further experiments with tightly controlled scopes of work that are timely and aligned with the shared roadmap where possible. Miscellaneous. The budget also contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineerings discretion. The line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO. This budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX for non-recurring costs. Contingency. Unforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly. The budget seeks approval for $52,800 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstreams discretion, shall it be required. Variance. Unused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle. In the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised. Deliverables. Goals. The Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal(s) The workstream exists to execute on the shared DAO Roadmap Proposal SCP-121: Roadmap Proposal Jan - Mar 31, 2023 [link] The DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market. The product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined. Reporting. The Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods availability via Discord, covering most time zones weekly product/engineering public meetings weekly governance calls on demand for any specific deliverable. Should the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits. Benefits. Fundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered. Drawbacks. Engineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAOs budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized. Vote. FOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from February 1 2023 to May 31st 2023 for $580,800 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX, with [hexadecimals] as the Workstream Leader.

The Olympus council would like to propose several amendments to the original OIP-91, including introducing a re-election framework, reporting requirements, the number of council members, and several miscellaneous improvements. - The council proposes a 1-year term for elected council members. The council will be put up for a vote of confidence, voted on by OHM holders. If the vote of confidence passes, the council is elected for a period of 1 year. If the vote of confidence fails, an election process will take place to elect a new council. The election will be done by DAO contributors above level 4 (full time equivalent) This is an interim solution until we can cement this in an OCG structure. The framework for replacing council members during this term remain unchanged (see OIP-91) - The council proposes formalizing the reporting requirements by the council. We propose a council update every other month within the DAO. We propose a council update every other month for the community. - The council proposes reducing the number of council members from 7 to 5 to reflect the changes in overall DAO size and structure. Council Framework. To offset against major holiday periods, we suggest the term to start in February. (Re-)Election procedure. In the last week of January and July, a vote of confidence will be posted on snapshot (or any future governance platform) to poll if the community is in favor of continuing with the current council composition or if it feels changes are needed. To aid this process and give the community insights into the current workings of the council, a council update should be provided before going to a vote. The choice for not doing a full re-election process every 12 months is done to reduce overhead, avoid friction and keep the focus on building out Olympus as opposed to time-consuming election processes. If, however, the OHM holders are dissatisfied with the performance of the council, we propose the following framework: We propose a 2-week election timeline which would start immediately after the conclusion of a negative vote of confidence. Week 1: DAO contributors can flag their desire to run for council during this week in a public channel in the DAO server, to avoid any risk of censorship. During this week, candidates should lay out their motivations and vision for Olympus. Additionally, they should explain what they would bring to the council. Week 2: At the start of week 2, all candidates who have submitted their motivation will be able to present this to other DAO contributors during a voice call in the DAO, the order of presentation will be randomized to prevent any favoritism. After this call, a blind vote will take place where DAO contributors above level 4 will be able to cast votes to the amount of council seats. We opt for a blind vote to reduce animosity and friction between DAO contributors. In case two or more contributors have the same amount of votes, another round of voting will have to be executed with only these candidates on the ballot. After the conclusion of the voting round(s), a vote will be presented to the community to confirm the composition of this council. In case of a positive vote, a hand-over will take place between the original and new council members to ensure a smooth transition. During this time, the previous council is still active. If the vote gets rejected, the process will have to start over again until a council is approved by the holders. The newly elected council will take its place at the start of the next week on Monday and will present themselves to the community during the first following community call. This proposal combines both ownership of the OHM holders, who ultimately will have the power to push for a new council while still giving a voice to the DAO contributors, who will have to execute the vision of the council and has unique insights into the capabilities of the candidates. Council size. We propose the reduction of council members from 7 to 5 for the following reasons: - Since the introduction of the first council, the DAO has consolidated significantly. We feel it is appropriate for the council to be smaller as well. - The reduction would increase the efficiency of the council. In the past cycle, it could be difficult to get the opinion of 7 members at the same time. - The cost of the council would be reduced, leaving more budget for other departments. - Zeus has not been an active council member and has been acting more as a senior advisor to Olympus, a capacity he will still be involved in going forward. - Indigo has indicated that he would like to step down from the council for the next cycle to focus more on development. The remaining council members are Apollo, Hohmward, Jala, Shadow and Wartull. Update on reporting requirements. The council has evaluated feedback both from the community and the DAO contributors and identified the need for increased transparency on the workings and decisions of the DAO. For this, we propose: - A council update every other month within the DAO. - A council update every other month for the community. A community Q&A was conducted on Thursday the 2nd of February to address community questions on the roles and responsibilities of the council.

Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting. Dated: 2023-01-26. --- Summary. This proposal is to enable Lido to distribute LDO rewards across the Aave v3 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism Liquidity Pools. The 'Emission_Admin' role for LDO on each network is to be assigned to a wallet controlled by the Lido DAO. Abstract. Lido seeks to distribute LDO rewards across to the various Aave v3 deployments. To achieve this, the 'EmissionManager' function assigns an owner to the 'Emission_Admin' role for LDO on each respective Aave v3 deployment, [1,2] The wallet with 'Emission Admin' permission for LDO on each aave v3 deployment then controls the distribution of only LDO rewards across the respective Liquidity Pool. Motivation. Enable Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards across the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools. The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered. Typically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the various Aave v3 Liquidity Pools. Specification. The 'EmissionManager', a governance controlled function, assigns the 'Emission_Admin' role for a specified token, LDO. The 'Emission_Admin' role controls the distribution of the specified token, LDO, across the specified Aave deployments. The 'Emission_Admin' can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Implementation. Set 'Emission_Admin' permission for LDO to the following Lido address: |Network|LDO Address|Emission Admin| | --- | --- | --- | |Ethereum|[hexadecimals]|[hexadecimals]| |Arbitrum|[hexadecimals]|[hexadecimals]| |Optimism|[hexadecimals]|[hexadecimals]| References.

Backing a stablecoin with Real Estate has 2 key competitive advantages that we believe add significant value to the stablecoin landscape: 1) Yield - The tokenized properties in the Real USD treasury are leased to tenants. This rental yield is paid out daily to holders in the form of a rebase. In addition to this if Real USD ever falls beneath 100% collateralization ratio, 50% of the daily rebase is instead added to the treasury to re-collateralize USDR. 2) Real Estate price appreciation - When priced in FIAT Real Estate has a long predictable history of appreciation. Over the last 50 years, the average sales price of a house in the United States grew from $27,000 in Q1 1970 to $383,000 in Q1 2020. This appreciation in the backing of USDR allows for [interesting design mechanisms]([link]) that contribute to additonal yield and lindyness of the system. History: Tangible has been around for 18 months tokenizing Fine wine, Gold bars, watches and most recently Real Estate. After tokenizing our first property we conceptualized Real USD. Real USD has only been around a few months. We launched V1 with a slightly different design which after launch we realized could be improved significantly with \"minting on gains, so we quickly launched V2 and are now ready to scale liquidity and market cap. We have spent significant time sourcing a backlog of properties that are ready to be tokenized to ensure that as the USDR market cap grows, the treasury and yield can scale. Motivation: Real USD (USDR) is new, we are looking for ways to grow deep liquidity for it. Balancers mechanism for automatically bribing pools with yield bearing assets is what initially grabbed our attention and drew us here, as it will highlight the structural advantages of backing a stablecoin with yield producing Real Estate. Specifications: 1. Governance: Real USD, the treasury composition and changes to the design will be governed by locked TNGBL token holders, this governance is not yet in place but will be soon. [4 of 5 multisig]([link])already required for any changes. 2. Oracles: We have our own oracles for properties at the moment, but are working with Chainlink to get set up, then true property valuations via 3rd party Hometrack.com can be reflected on chain in Real Time so the treasury values and the collateralization ratio are upto date, this also allows for \"minting on gains to work more effectively in real time. 3. Audits: Our first audit completed, final version of report will be ready this week then will share here. (No major issues) 4. Centralization vectors: The Real Estate obviously exists in the real world as is managed by an entity, Tangible Custody, this entity collects rent and converts to USDC and sends to the rent smart contracts. 5. Market History: In our short time since launch we have not lost peg. 6. Value: We have a pool on Curve but intend to only provide bribes and incentives on Balancer due to the advantages provided by BIP-19.

GotchiID: 16559, 2824. Hello frens, We would like to put forward our own proposal that we believe is the fairest way to allocate the funds whilst also protecting asset holders. We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO. The split would be as follows: Liquidity: 25% The DAO: 25% Pixelcraft: 25% Protocol rewards: 25% By protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. A yes vote for protocol rewards in this case does not mean a yes vote for ongoing RF in its current iteration, it protects funds to be used to make sure that protocol assets remain liquid and sufficiently included in the economic cycle/paradigm going forward. A yes vote for protocol rewards signals to loyal supporters of the protocol that the original vision remains intact, rather than being diverted into new and unproven games and business models. Without inclusion/correlation between GHST and assets, great economic disruption could follow the turning off of curve for asset owners. A stream of funding protocol rewards for two years not only creates an ongoing source of buy side liquidity for the GHST token, it also allows market participants to trust in the correlation between GHST and protocol assets. As we prepare to release the Forge and GBM different assets, we have the choice to signal to market participants whether they are bidding into a single RF season, or towards inclusion in the economic benefits of the platform for a full two years from here.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-02-02. Summary. MAI is a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin minted by the QiDAO protocol. MAI is minted by qiDAO protocol users by locking collateral in vaults. For more information about MAI please refer to MAI V3 ARC 2. This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to increase MAI borrow cap on the Aave V3 polygon market. Abstract. This ARFC proposes to increase the MAI borrow cap to 1M MAI to reflect market demand for this asset. Motivation. Due to market demand for MAI liquidity, MAI utilization is close to borrow cap, and the current borrow cap is set at a level that has a probable effect on both MAI supplied (total cap making it impossible to reach uOptimal at the current level of liquidity) and drives out potential demand. Allowing an increase of this borrow cap will allow supply and demand to find another equilibrium for the benefit of liquidity providers, borrowers & protocol revenue with expected increased borrow demand.

References/Useful links: > Link to:  [Website]([link])  [Audit Reports]([link])  [Issuance & Redemption]([link])  [Documentation]([link])pdf)  [Twitter]([link])  Contracts: [Ethereum]([link]), [Avalanche]([link]), [Polygon]([link]), [Solana]([link]), [BNB]([link]) Protocol Description: > The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 5 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. Users can use the web application on [BiLira.co]([link]) to conduct TRYB issuances and redemptions between their local banks and their digital wallets. > >The minting of on-chain TRYB is from fully collateralized bank deposits. Users connect their wallets and deposit fiat currency (TRY) into BiLiras bank account. BiLira confirms the transaction and verifies the smart contract. The smart contract then mints corresponding TRYB tokens and sends them to the customers crypto wallet. Corresponding fiat currency is held in BiLiras reserves. This information can be verified through our audit reports that are done via 3 party firms.(link to the reports can be found below) Another factor is that BiLira doesn't hold the users crypto assets. The issuance process is non-custodial and the assets are sent to the users wallet addresses that they provide. For redemption, users send their TRYB to their BiLira redemption wallets, and convert the specified TRYB to Turkish Lira through [bilira.co]([link]) All of the redeemed TRYB from customers are burned in a monthly routine. BiLira firm uses enterprise-grade multi-layer security measures such as Multi-Sig wallets through Fireblocks. Motivation: > Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey is one of the highest in the world and continues to grow as a result of the increasing demand for digital assets and financial services. A survey by [ING]([link]) illustrates that almost 18% of Turkish people have used or owned cryptocurrency in some form, compared to 9% across the European Union. This has been driven by the high inflation rate and economic uncertainty that has been experienced in Turkey over the last few years. The Turkish Lira (TRY) has been especially severely impacted, with its value dropping by over 40% since the beginning of 2020. As a result, Turkish users actively seek for alternative financial instruments and solutions. By creating the [TRYB/USDC pool]([link]), we wanted to open the gates of Balancer to the Turkish DeFi users. > >With such a large base of crypto users, TRYB pools on Balancer would provide Turkish users with easy access to the decentralized finance ecosystem and make it easier for them to adopt and trade crypto assets. > >Furthermore, by incentivizing TRYB on Balancer there will be an incentive for users to provide liquidity and actively swap tokens. This will consequently result in more users joining the platform, increased trading volumes and the pool established for TRYB on Balancer will also help increase awareness of BiLiras token and its utility as a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the Turkish Lira. Providing this type of service could draw in new Turkish traders who may not have previously considered investing in cryptocurrencies or utilizing decentralized platforms. For instance, as more people begin using TRYB tokens for their transactions or contribute to the relevant liquidity pool, traders will have more opportunities to arbitrage between different exchanges and earn profits from price discrepancies across markets. As a matter of fact, incentivizing TRYB on Balancer will also create new opportunities for institutional investors who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolio with digital assets. Specifications: You may find the full details on the project in the BiLira whitepaper and for all the other information please refer to [BiLira homepage.]([link]) 1. Governance: TRYB is centralized and issued by BiLira and does not have a governance forum. 2. Oracles: TRYB has a Chainlink oracle that can be found here: [Oracle.]([link]) 3. Audits: BiLiras TRYB is being audited twice a year by an independent auditor to ensure all TRYBs are fully backed by TRY. [See the latest audits here]([link]) 4. Centralization vectors: TRYB is inherently centralized and issued by BiLira. Users who complete the KYC/AML process are allowed to issue and redeem TRYB for TRY 24/7. 5. Market History: TRYB has been on blockchains since early 2019. It has been listed and used on numerous DEXs and CEXs since its launch. Until today more than 5 billion TRYB has been issued by BiLira to fulfill the user demand. [See Coingecko history here.]([link]) From August 2020 and up until 31 October 2022, TRYB was within +/-1% of the peg 93.14% of the time and within +/-2% 98.90% of the time. There are some market places where there is lack of liquidity which does not make a sufficient impact on the peg. Outliers on the TRYB/TRY peg distribution rarely occur on these marketplaces with relatively less volume. However, TRYB peg is guaranteed with the TRY held in the bank account of BiLira.

At the current run rate, approximately 2,941,299.13 HOP is distributed each month, which equates to approximately 3.53% of the total HOP supply each year. This RFC hopes to achieve consensus that the HOP Community Multisig should be refilled at this time in order to continue efficient distributions from the HOP DAO into the hands of HOP stakeholders. Actions. If consensus is achieved, this proposal will send 11,765,196.52 HOP from the HOP DAO to the HOP Community Multisig. This number represents roughly 4 months of distribution and approximately 1.16% of the total HOP supply, capping the liabilities of the HOP Community Multisig.

GotchiID: 4563. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days. Final Discourse Thread: [link] Original Discourse Thread: [link] INTRODUCTION. AavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST Bonding Curve. This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAOs DAI stable coin. Closing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions. The Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today. \"The Curve is forever is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHSTs tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion. While MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the \"Endgame plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool. Even if one concludes that DAIs risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAIs depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable. Aavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own. AavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the companys readiness to also manage the DAI at scale. With nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC'd and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people! It is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve. Allocation of the Curves DAI. Turning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems. So far, the DAI in the Curves contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curves closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol. I have offered a separate Signal Proposal to allocate 70% of such DAI to AavegotchiDAO (40% of the total DAI collateral being earmarked specifically for Liquidity Provisions in a separate multisig) and the remaining 30% to go to the team that kickstarted it all and continues to develop both the protocol and the Gotchiverse, Pixelcraft Studios. Take this proposal and the allocation proposal into consideration together. If my proposed allocation does not pass, there would need to be a new Signal Proposal to take its place before the process of closing the Curve could begin. Process: This proposal is for us to close the GHST Bonding Curve in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps: 1. Pass an AGIP on Snapshot confirming AavegotchiDAOs intention and terms. 2. Migrate the required 8% of total GHST supply back to Ethereum so we can reach quorum in our Curves on-chain voting system (long established on Aragon contracts) 3. Complete the Aragon-based vote. It is at this point the Curve will immediately close and any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the original Snapshots terms. 4. The Curve closes and all DAI are distributed according to the terms decided by AavegotchiDAO in a subsequent AGIP. Risks. The risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes. Without deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market. There is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility. Benefits. The benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review: 1. Remove all risk of Aavegotchis success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI) 2. Complete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties. 3. Improve GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time. Conclusion. For the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystems meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we've learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the visions development is completely within AavegotchiDAOs control. We are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Lets use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOG7m7DnE3EN0E6UfbPqcRVmGr2Q", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954103, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests closing the GHST Bonding Curve in order to remove reliance on MakerDAO's DAI stable coin and secure funding for AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios.

Discussion: [link] short description: Add wstETH to Arbitrum Aave v3 deployment as collateral with borrowing enabled and the option to create an Ethereum eMode. author: Llama - Defi_Consulting. dated: 2023-02-05. --- Summary. This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Arbitrum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Across the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled. The stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aaves revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave. The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers. Motivation. The stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B) This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. Demand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aaves revenue. The charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and $279k during January 2023. Listing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool. Specification.

The DAO is seeking approval for a change to the current compensation framework, which puts more weight on the timely delivery of projects. Motivation. The compensation framework outlined in [OIP-102]([link]) has served the DAO well over the past 6 months. However, we believe there is room for improvement. Due to the overall market sentiment and events that transpired in this year, the OKRs, most of which were market-driven, have not been met. These OKRs were meant to be difficult, but the main issue we found was that the contributors couldn't directly affect them and thus felt unmotivated when it was clear the market wouldn't allow us to reach them. The proposal below outlines how we plan to tackle that problem, as well as ensure timely completion of projects that are in the best interest of Olympus and its community. Proposal. Bonus. Instead of the current OKR-based bonuses system outlined in OIP-102, allow for a total bonus budget of $1,000,000, to be paid in (g)OHM. This budget would be allocated to projects submitted by the DAO to the community for approval, with the requisite that in 2023 there are at least 3 projects passed by the community and with a maximum bonus per project of $333,333. All DAO contributors above an average contribution level of 4, active in the DAO over the course of a project and at bonus payout would receive their share of the bonus allocated to that project at the end of the calendar year. The contributors bonus share would be weighted based on the average contribution level over the course of a project. As long as projects are completed within a month of the deadline (deadline + 1 month), the bonus for that project would be paid out in full. After that point, the bonus would start to decay on the following scale. In addition, for the Council members and Strategos (department leads), given their lower base compensation compared to the role, introduce a potential bonus of $120k per person, to be distributed only in the case of successful and timely (deadline + 3 months) completion of all projects that passed a community vote, again, no less than 3 over the course of 2023. In the case of completed projects that had their bonus decayed due to not meeting deadlines, but no more than 3m past the deadline, take the weighted average of the bonus percentages to calculate the percentage of $120k that has been earned. This compensation structure is meant to align the compensation with the responsibilities of the department leads, responsible for their respective departments, and the Council, responsible for overseeing the whole DAO operations. Projects. Projects that unlock bonuses must be deemed high-impact projects and will be submitted to a community vote via an OIP. Each project proposal must contain a description of the project, definition of what constitutes project completion and a deadline for which the DAO will be held accountable for. Along with the project spec, it must contain the bonus allocated to it for timely completion (100%) In the extraordinary case that, after the initial project proposal to the community, a project deadline needs to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances or better solutions/improtvements are found, or a project needs to be deprioritized or canceled for justifiable reasons, the contributors would need to request this from the community and provide a detailed explanation in a OIP forum post. Base Compensation. Up until now, the DAO has worked within the limits outlined in OIP-102 - a $370k monthly base compensation budget, with an allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $462.5k. Given the proposed introduction of project based bonuses, as well as a more efficient DAO today, we propose that the monthly base compensation be reduced to $280k, with the same allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $350k This is a 24% reduction in the monthly base compensation budget. !([link]) Legal. We predict a legal budget of up to $200k will be needed for 2023. The law firms will be assisting Olympus with the following: - Evaluate potential compliance improvement areas. - Identify any proposed risk mitigation steps to be taken by Olympus to comply with applicable law and regulation. - Evaluate legal requirements that mandate, and/or prudential risk mitigation considerations. - Advise Olympus with respect to the design of any compliance programs, and preparation of appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls integral to such programs, for presentation to the Olympus Community. - Prepare summary recommendations(s) describing the proposed risk mitigation steps, and compliance programs to be implemented, for approval by the Olympus Community. Audits. As outlined in [OIP-98]([link]), the community approved a yearly audit budget of $500,000. This is just an allowance and does not mean the DAO will need to spend the full amount. Services, Subscriptions, Other Operational Costs. The estimates for subscriptions and other operational costs are based on historical data. Services and service providers (simulations, risk analysis, etc.) are variable and not included in this budget framework. Instead, they would be listed in the quarterly report. 2023 Budget. The budget below is the projected maximum, with maximum spend in all categories (not including potential budget flex of 25%) and full bonuses unlocked. !([link]) The DAO currently holds 1,559,510 OHM worth $15,454,744, visible [here]([link]) The spend for 2022 can be found in our Q4 report available on the [Transparency page]([link]) In the case that market conditions change and the compensation needs to be adjusted in order for Olympus to stay competitive, the Council would propose an amendment to the community for approval. The Council also reserves the right, outlined in [OIP-91]([link]), to approve urgent expenses, including but not limited to security-related expenses, tooling costs, contracted services. These expenses must be detailed in the quarterly report. If this proposal passes, it would nullify and supersede OIP-102.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOG8Lgq5EY0cJbgqsdVfwCzsEbqz", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954104, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The DAO wants to change its compensation system to reward timely project completion.

Communities: Discord - [link] Governance Discussion - [link] Governance Voting - [link] 1. Twitter - [link] Reddit - [link] Summary: This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to add rETH to the Ethereum V3 market as a reserve. Motivation. The stETH Reserve on Aave V2 is the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.47B in deposits, exceeding ETH ($1.33B) and USDC ($885M) This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH. LSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets. Onboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience. Aave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization. Rocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem. Specification. 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? The Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal. Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform. The ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions. the ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token? Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators. Rocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH. rETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH. The rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time. Simply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards. Without a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions. Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold. Abstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership) 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? rETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators. Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value. rETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens. rETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans. rETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave. rETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Rocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years. The Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021. rETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2. The Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool  Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2. 5. How is the rETH token currently used? Balancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M. Uniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity. rETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI. image. image. 1231203 17.2 KB. Its likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding. See the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases. 6. Emission schedule. There is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? rETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH. The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities. 8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity) Market capitalisation: $287 118 738. 24H Volume ~$3.75M. Decentralized exchange liquidity pools.

A comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report: [rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9. Risk parameters. The Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work. As such, we recommend the following parameters: Isolation Mode - No. While isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode. Borrowable - Yes. We are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aaves markets. LT - 74%; LTV 67% We recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we've identified above. LB - 7.5% We recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH. RF - 15% LPF - 0.1. Debt Ceiling - NA. Supply Cap - 10K. Borrow Cap - 1200. Our analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets. | Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | rETH | NO | YES | YES | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A | 10K | 1200 | Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor. rETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later. Parameter | Recommendation. --- | --- Base | 0. Slope 1 | 0.07. Uoptimal | 0.45. Slope 2 | 3.0. Reserve Factor | 0.15. Under these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI) From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

GotchiID: 13482. This sigprop is for funding the Infinity Keys Aavegotchi Onboarding Hunt. Infinity Keys put forth a discussion forum post here: [[link]]([link]), has attended several Saturday Hangouts and Sunday DAO meetings to discuss their proposal, and include longtime members of the Aavegotchi community. If you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr. - 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new plays, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives. - 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a paccode hidden in the gotchiverse. - These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play. - At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants. - There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops. - Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi. One question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And whats more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete. We have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community more players will come test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi. One of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point. This onboarding comes from a deep understanding of the Gotchi community and how the system functions from an insiders perspective, but has the Alchemica to reach new players and bring them in. ![[image]]([link])\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary. In SCP-80, ShapeShift Product Workstream leader Diggy made the case for data analytics to inform our path to product market fit, and the proposal passed Snapshot at the beginning of June. Pendo was formally integrated with the ShapeShift app at the start of Q3 2022, and the Product and Marketing workstreams started tracking data on our product features for those who have opted in to sharing anonymized in-app action data. In addition to Pendo, the two workstreams will continue to explore ways to pull on-chain data as well as structure and synthesize in-depth in-app data to give us new and more comprehensive insights with the goal of improving our product, messaging, marketing, and business development strategies. This proposal is intended to address the issue of privacy as it relates to tracking user data and actions both on and off the app. The Product and Marketing workstreams recognize and respect the role of privacy in the ethos of the ShapeShift DAO. We would like to work with the community to establish a working definition for privacy that can be used to enhance operational efficiency within the workstreams of the DAO with the goal of using this definition to improve the efficiency of delegated decisions. Abstract. If this proposal passes, the DAO will have successfully established an operative meaning for privacy that can empower workstreams to make autonomous decisions while remaining within the bounds set by the community. This definition would negate the current need to pass a governance proposal each time the Product or Marketing workstreams intend to test a new type of user behavior through data tracking for the purposes of improving user features and constructing effective marketing funnels as long as the feature or strategy falls within the bounds of the definition. If these powers were ever abused and/or used in such a way as to concern the community, the DAO can amend the working definition established by this proposal to narrow its scope appropriately. Motivation. The primary motivation for this proposal is to increase efficiency of decision making related to the application of user data tracking within the ShapeShift app. Developing high-performing product features and marketing campaigns is a unique challenge in Web3, as there is a de facto expectation of data pseudonymity. In addition, the DAO is committed to offering a private version of our app that does not include any analytics or tracking. As a result, we are looking for creative ways to gather and synthesize the data necessary to determine answers to the key questions raised by Diggy in SCP-80. A clear definition of privacy and subsequent delegation of related decision making to the Product and Marketing workstreams would improve our ability to develop data gathering strategies required to answer these questions. Specification. The proposed working definition for privacy is as follows: \"Data privacy means the ability of a user to determine when, how, and to what extent their personal information is shared with others as well as how that data is correlated with other trackable/metricisable events inside and outside the application. As mentioned above, ShapeShift currently maintains a private version of its app so users can opt out of data collection entirely. This option ensures the DAO offers a version of the product that guarantees complete data privacy\u4e00upholding the most extreme interpretation of \"no tracking/no data collection. Importantly, the definition of \"data privacy above will be used to create a framework for data privacy decisions related to users who login via app.shapeshift.com. Data Tracking Details: Data: Anonymized click-throughs and user journey. The previous proposal explicitly excluded sending hashes of users' public keys. This proposal seeks to update that to permit tracking of anonymized data for the purposes of product improvement. Hashed wallet id. Hashed public keys. Asset ids belonging to public keys. Total portfolio (wallet) fiat balances. Account balances, in fiat and crypto units. By hashing a users wallet id (a uniquely generated string) and associated public account ids (per chain), we will be able to derive insights and make better product decisions around user persona profiles and how different types of users are using the app. Hashes are unique and not reversible - this does not enable us to deanonymize a user from hashed data back to public keys. Private keys, or encrypted or hashed versions, never have or will be tracked. When: user data is collected from the moment a user enters app.shapeshift.com and agrees/opts in to sharing anonymized user data. Mobile app users are tracked as part of the terms of service. No personal identifiable information will ever be tracked. How and to what extent: Analytics will track anonymized click events within our app for the purpose of understanding user retention rates, which features our users adopt, identifying drop offs or potential issues in our user flows, and to generally understand how users navigate throughout our application. We may sometimes also use an analytics tool to run anonymous surveys or polls with our users, to help inform product decisions or gather feedback. In some cases it could also be used to identify the parts of the world our users are in and how they first entered the ShapeShift ecosystem. This information will be used to help us with SEO, user acquisition funnels and marketing strategy. On-chain tracking will respect the pseudonymity of user wallets, and utilize analytics for critical business tasks such as building complete marketing funnels, feature planning, feature utilization and verifying partner revenue reporting. The anonymized data collected via the ShapeShift app will be available through the analytics provider/s and analytic platform access will be granted to relevant workstream contributors and shared during calls or office hours with the community. ShapeShift will:  Never have access to users private keys nor collect any personal information.  Never collect a users IP address.  Never sell user data.  Never gate features for users that opt-out of sharing data. Benefits. Defining \"privacy and allowing Product and Marketing Workstreams to explore various data collection strategies will allow these Workstreams to further measure the success of our products leading to better feature engagement, higher user retention and finding the best product market fit. This definition will give parameters for workstreams to operate so that the core values of the DAO\u4e00such as privacy\u4e00can continue to be scrupulously upheld while giving workstreams the agency to operate effectively within those confines. Users will continue to have the option to opt-in to sharing data or choose to proceed with the complete \"Private version that collects no data of any kind. Drawbacks. Giving workstreams the agency to implement tracking within these confines means that the broader community will have less jurisdiction over the specific tools implemented by workstreams in the future to collect, synthesize, and aggregate data. As long as the strategy falls within the bounds set by this proposal, a workstream would have the authority to execute on it.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nSummary. This is a proposal to start the Gearbox Business Development (GBBD) Initiative, which will lead efforts in attracting large users to the protocol. Due to budgeting and planning constraints, it will likely consist of a single member to start. I, Jared Hedglin, working through Hedglin Consulting, would like to propose myself for the role spanning an initial three month engagement. Motivation. Gearbox has the potential to become a leading DeFi protocol financially empowering an entire new class of investors who may not have access to similar financial services due to geography or economic status. However, to establish the project as the dominant composable leverage protocol - a potentially enormous category - deeper liquidity on the protocols supply-side is necessary. As evidenced by high utilization, there is clear PMF expressed from the borrowing side of Gearbox; however, more effort is required for growing the total amount of liquidity provided to Gearbox. Like many leading DeFi projects, Gearbox will need qualified contributors to actively build relationships with liquidity providers, borrowers, protocols, wallet platforms, service providers and more in order to attract liquidity and users to the ecosystem. While Gearboxs current $100m TVL is extremely impressive for an early-stage project, the protocols competitive yields could easily support a large influx of liquidity. Importantly, many whales, DeFi funds, power users, and institutions require some level of human interfacing with the DAO in order to to gain comfort with LPing. Therefore, it is my belief that a coordinated BD program, spearheaded by a specialized subDAO, would deliver outlier value to the Gearbox protocol. Specification. The GBBD Initiative would serve two high level goals: increasing Gearboxs adoption and visibility among potential liquidity providers and DeFi power users. The funding for this subDAO will be used to unlock on-chain research to find whales, setting up calls with institutions to educate them on Gearbox, speaking to broad audiences on Twitter spaces and podcasts, as well as representing Gearbox at key industry events. This section breaks those overarching goals down into specific tasks. Goal 1: Increase Gearboxs Adoption. Develop a robust go-to-market strategy for a pipeline of LPs and borrowers with DeFi power users, protocols, funds, companies, and institutional investors. Create and document processes like a CRM, feedback loop, continuity plan for growing this role and subdao. Integrate best-in-class technologies, such as a CRM, to track and manage subDAO relationships. Goal 2: Increase Gearboxs Visibility. Build relationships and partnerships to bring Gearbox to other user interfaces and applications (especially in a potential partnership/referral program) Establish a professional digital and physical presence for Gearbox at key industry events. Duration. This proposal recommends a three month engagement, which can be extended by the DAO at the end of the term. Subsequent proposals will likely include additional 3-month extensions. This approach allows for the setting of high level KPIs to be set with sufficient time to achieve them, but also allows the DAO to periodically monitor and provide feedback on progress with regards to the overarching goals defined above. Proposed Budget. I was previously working for Boxcode and Gearbox Protocol Limited, the companies that raised the seed round. My compensation and expenses were the following: Total salary: $280K/year (included insurance expenses, travel, conference, and business expenses) Token vesting: 5 million $GEAR to be locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months (as per the current contributor vesting schedules) I would like to propose a \"quarterly salary plus expenses of 45k USDC, which is equivalent to a $180k per year salary. This represents a 36% pay cut, while still maintaining the additional legal/insurance/conference expenses. With this budget, I will be able to put forth my full time and efforts for serving the goals of this subDAO and supporting the Gearbox protocol. Compensation Benchmarking. According to data from Pave 1, the median salary for a VP of Business Development is around $185k and a total annual cash compensation of $200k. I will be taking on more responsibilities than just a VP of BD, but added this comparison for context. Its worth noting that these numbers do not include benefits such as health insurance, which I will have to pay for out of pocket. Additionally, there is no bonus associated with this position, so the total cash compensation is equal to the base salary. In comparison to the market, this proposed salary is competitive but slightly below average for the DAO. These numbers also do not consider any additional liability or risks. Breakdown. $50k USDC for the 3 month grant period. ($45k salary + $5k in expenses + unlocking tokens) The DAO does not currently use any streaming payments mechanism, so I propose delivering this in a one-time payment. 3 million (3,000,000) $GEAR to be locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months, in line with the same vesting schedule for other contributors. At todays fair market value, this approximately $45k, but represents both future upside as well as uncertainty in risk in both the market and future regulations. If I were to stay for a full year, then 12m GEAR tokens would represent 0.12% of the token float, which is a comparable number often offered to early contributors that take the risk of leaving \"comfortable and stable positions. I will cover expenses out of this distribution to attend additional conferences : ETH Denver (definitely, already booked) 2-3 other conferences which will be selected shortly based on the quality of attendees. Team. I, Jared Hedglin, would lead the GBBD SubDAO. I am excited to announce my candidacy for leading the GBBD SubDAO. As a dedicated contributor to Gearbox since March, I am eager to continue my efforts in growing the protocol. With my strong background in institutional crypto, boasting 4+ years of experience, I have played a key role in high-impact projects such as DAO fundraising round pitches, strategy development for V2 launch, and promoting crypto conferences and meetups. I have also been featured on 2 podcasts and 4+ Twitter spaces, and have been available to help with Ninja Mode whitelists. Furthermore, I have successfully led efforts to get Gearbox covered by top industry publications such as Nexus, Token Terminal, Exponential, Cer Live, and others, while working to expand our presence in more DeFi front ends. I believe I'm the right candidate to lead this effort for Gearbox as I have more than 4 years of experience bringing crypto products to market for leading companies. Prior to Gearbox, I was an Executive Director at BitGo, where I was responsible for selling wallet and custody infrastructure and led the charge to integrate BitGos wallets with Metamask. Prior to BitGo, I worked on the Institutional Sales and Trading Desk at Coinbase. Prior to Coinabse, I sold the market leading white-label exchange technology at Alpha Point and led the international Account Management team. Although I may not be degen enough to mint a DegenScore Beacon, I feel that its important that I can even reference that in a proposal. The community, including degens, chads, and whales have been incredibly supportive and impressive getting the protocol to its current TVL in a deep bear market and in a year with multiple black swans, however, in order to get to a top 10 protocol, then there needs to be someone (and eventually a team) actively working to grow these metrics.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOGNBswkwDTKj1NYRYPVnDBnEhQ6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954119, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests the creation of the Gearbox Business Development (GBBD) Initiative, which aims to attract large users to the protocol.

Multisig is to seed a new 50/50 GEAR/stETH pool on Balancer with 0.3% fee, using 300 ETH from strategic round 2 funds and matching value in GEAR from the main treasury. 2. Modify liquidity mining from [GIP-36]([link]) from 4 months to 6 months, keeping the total quantity the same (13.33m GEAR) 3. Divert 1/3rd of liquidity mining funds from GIP-36 to bribing the Balancer pool through Aura/Hidden Hand. 3. Switch all remaining liquidity mining (from GIP 36 and Cider'd) to bribe vlCVX voters through votium. 4. DAO will collect all earned BAL and AURA rewards and lock them, voting for GEAR/WETH emissions with its locked positions. End result: 1. Multisig owns 600 ETH worth of Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity. 2. 4.44m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity pool. 2. 8.88m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool. 3. ~15m GEAR over 4 months is also used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool (from Cider'd) Justification. Cider'd raised more fees than were anticipated, thus resulting in high APR even at high amounts of liquidity. Keeping cider'd rewards over the 4 month period helps continue to absorb volatility for the new GEAR token, while splitting and extending the current GIP-36 program creates an assurance of rewards continuing after Cider'd rewards are used up (subject to anything that overrides this proposal in the future) Multiple liquidity sources are necessary to make an oracle feasible. Oracles are necessary for many third party integrations in DeFi, which can bring utility to the GEAR token. Creating liquidity on Balancer will also diversify partnerships, and the Aura and Bal rewards will create a semi-sustainable baseline of liquidity incentivization for the DAO over time. stETH is used as a pairing as yield bearing assets recieve rebates from trading fees, which are recyled into bribes for veBAL holders. There are risks in pairing with stETH, but these risks are lessened significantly by the fact that the curve liquidity pool will remain as the largest liquidity pool for GEAR. Bribing is used due to efficiency. The bribe multiplier is defined as the amount of emissions sent to LPers per $1 in bribes. For CRV its ~[$1.87]([link]) and for [Aura]([link]) its $3 - both making bribes a no-brainer. With the DAO owning initial POL in balancer, it will ensure that excess bribes are not wasted (as they will be returned to the DAO) Additionally, this would allow the DAO to build an Aura position that can be used to create additional rewards for LPers (including the DAO itself) The position would be worth the stake (600 ETH proposed) x the APR (~100% in current Curve v2 pool), and could be used to justify reducing liquidity mining expenses in the future. Execution. Prior to executing this proposal, the following must happen: 1. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a Curve and Convex gauge for GEAR/WETH (in progress) 2. A DAO contributor must seed a GEAR/WETH pool on Balancer, [here]([link]) 3. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a BAL and AURA gauge for GEAR/WETH, following the process here: [link] 4. A DAO contributor will need to contact votium to get GEAR enabled as a valid bribe token: [link] as well as contact Hidden Hand (Redacted) for the same reason. Additionally, DAO contributors should seek to get both GEAR pools adopted into various aggregation services such as Matcha, Paraswap, 1inch, etc. Multisig Bribing Instructions. 2. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to votium (for the Curve pool): [link] (or for tracking purposes, could do the Cider'd and normal LM bribes separately) 3. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to Hidden Hand (for the Balancer pool): [link] Note hidden hand and votium are utilized due to simplicity. Other bribe options exist, including Paladin and StakeDAO solutions to bribing veCRV holders. A future proposal could suggest switching Votium bribes to one of these platforms. This proposal could come at any time - its a trivial task for the multisig to switch sending bribes from Votium to another platform, so the majority of the work is explaining to the DAO how it works and why it is better. Voting. Voting will be simple \"for\" or \"against\" the full plan with an \"abstain\" option. Voting is ranked choice: 1. Do All. 2. Do All Except Deposit Treasury Funds. 3.

Protocol Description Synapse is a cross-chain communications protocol, launched Q3 2021. Synapse enables the transfer of reserve assets (stablecoins, ether, etc.) and partner assets (e.g. gOHM, VSTA, GMX, etc.) across a number of EVM and non-EVM compatible chains. Since launch, Synapse has processed $12.5b worth of cross-chain bridge transactions, across hundreds of thousands of transactions. Synapse has a native governance token SYN, which is distributed to liquidity providers. SYN is currently tradable on both decentralized and centralized exchanges, with robust liquidity currently on SushiSwap. Motivation SYN currently has a large 50/50 pool of liquidity on Sushi. As of this proposals writing, the pool has liquidity of $10m, with over $10 million worth of trading volume in the past 24 hours. Synapse as a protocol is incentivizing the liquidity of the pool with SYN incentives. Sushi also has incentivized the pool with a small amount of SUSHI, totaling ~$1,500 a day. Synapse can increase the yield of the pool by migrating liquidity to Balancer, then incentivizing vlAURA votes for the pool via Hidden Hand. With a current voting incentive efficiency over 2.5x, Synapse will benefit greatly from migrating to Balancer. Specifications - Governance: The Synapse DAO is the overarching governance structure of the protocol. DAO memmbers contribute to the protocol and help curate proposals for larger decisions. You can find out more information here: [[link]]([link]) - Oracles: The protocol does not rely on external oracles at the moment. All relevant contract work is done on chain. - Audits: Synapse has a history of audits from Certik, OpenZeppelin, and Quantstamp, along with ongoing audits. More information about Synapses audit history can be found [here]([link]) - Centralization vectors: There are no direct lines of centralization, smart contracts custody funds on each side of the bridge. - Market history: SYN has been an actively traded coin since Q3 2021.

This is proposal to add Coinbase ETH (cbETH) as an AllowedList asset for Credit Account users, for all the current (and soon upcoming FRAX) passive pools. Motivation. In a couple of months' time, we will have the ETH Shanghai upgrade which will allow ETH stakers to finally withdraw the ETH they have been locking up since 2020. The amount of ETH to be unlocked is about 16% of the overall supply and a vast majority of these ETH are likely to be deployed back through LSDs (like LIDO, cbETH, rocket pool etc) Moreover, its possible to expect even more ETH to be staked as the risk of liquidity will gradually start perishing with Shanghai settling down in scared minds. An LSD or liquid staking derivative is where a staker is able to stake their ETH and in turn receive a \"receipt token like stETH - which then effectively offers to liquidity to their staked position. And with this, they also accumulate the yield generated on staking, which is where Gearbox comes in. Given LSDs are one of the most sustainable sources of yield, the ability to lever them up produces a great opportunity for sustainable high yields potentially over 15% at manageable risk. Further, given the size of the unlock, this also presents to us a chance to grow our own TVL. Thus this proposal aims at adding cbETH based LSD strategies to the Gearbox LLSD cohort alongside the existing stETH strategies. Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (\"cbETH) is a utility token that represents Ethereum 2 (ETH2), which is ETH staked through Coinbase. Coinbase customers can wrap their locked staked ETH to receive cbETH, which is an asset that can be traded, moved on-chain, and used in DeFi and other dapps. cbETH is known as a liquid staking token because it allows holders to get the benefits of staking without lockups or unbonding periods. cbETH is a standard ERC-20 token designed using the cToken model  a model created by Compound Finance to represent depository assets in their protocol. cbETH maintains a conversion rate that represents the amount of underlying ETH2, and Coinbase will wrap or unwrap at this rate without charging fees. The liquidity of cbETH on DEXes is much lower than on stETH (~$19M on Uniswap and ~$8M on Curve), however, there is quite deep liquidity on Coinbase. This allows being sure that at the current scale of Gearbox protocol, the liquidators will not face a lack of liquidity. However, it is proposed to put the LT a little less than that of stETH.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

This proposal incorporates updates to the [prior discussion]([link]) It requests approval for the authority to donate up to a maximum ceiling of 22M LDO to a grants association for use in a Token Reward Plan (TRP), a framework which will distribute voting LDO tokens spread over a period of up-to four years to DAO contributors. The proposal will enable a single universal arrangement for contributors to participate in DAO governance that is connected to their continuous contribution periods. It will also offboard the burden and risk of DAO commitments to the contributors to a single purpose grants association. The association will receive the donations over time and will make grants of LDO from the association into the hands of contributors according to the parameters of the TRP described below. Democratising governance participation by increasing the number of independent actors will enhance the resilience of the DAOs treasury to resist governance attacks, improve routine quorum, and reward long-time contributors with LDO at the same time. Abstract. Approve the donation of up-to a maximum ceiling of 22M LDO to be transferred over a four year timeline to the grants associations multisig. The signers of the multisig will be members of a not-for-profit grants association. The purpose of the association will be to own the multisig and to assure the integrity of a grants program described by the TRP. This will include the audit of the eligibility of the TRP participants, and of the distributions of governance tokens to long-time contributors according to the [formula]([link]) set-out in the original forum post. Initially it will be done manually with the intention to automate by smart contract. If this proposal is implemented the following will change: the DAO will offboard the responsibility for current and future LDO commitments to contributors to the grants association; many contributor LDO grants have been approved by DAO voting and require the implementation of a means to disburse and receive LDO, this situation will be remedied; a single universal LDO distribution framework will be established which will bring certainty to all stakeholders and reduce and eventually eliminate the burden of honouring a diversity of bespoke LDO arrangements over time; for a minority of contributors that have indicated a preference to respect their previous grant arrangement to its finality, the burden of honouring the arrangements can be assumed by the grants association, and when, and if, a prior arrangement is complete the contributor who remains can have an option to re-engage with TRP if they continue to contribute to the DAO; there would be a net increase in the number of independent rational actors participating in DAO decision making. Motivation. Since genesis the DAO has made a variety of commitments to contributors to grant them governance participation under a variety of formulas at different points in time. For many contributors the commitments are in arrears. The arrears are in part because of the resource draw and burden to honour the multiple different arrangements on an bespoke basis and also the absence of a dedicated resource to deal with the obligations. One side of the issue is resolved by harmonising LDO commitments into a simple fair and universal framework. Another side is resolved by offboarding existing and future contributor obligations to an amenable third party. The benefits of honouring the commitments to existing LDO members are many. An LDO distribution plan enables the existing LDO holders decision making to be enhanced by the participation of contributors who built and continue to build the ecosystem, ensures enhanced resilience from coercion or attack on the Lido DAO or the Lido on Ethereum protocol, and maintains positive relationships with the contributors. An activity like the TRP described is outside of the DAOs immediate core business. This activity attracts an entirely different risk universe than overseeing the development of liquid staking projects. At a global scale, local legal compliance is complex and more easily achieved by localising the activity within a legal wrapper. This path enhances trust between the DAO and the receiving association since the multisig signers are be ascertainable, it will provide a level of protection for the signers, it can respond and service the demands of the local compliance needs of individual contributors that the DAO cannot do, and it offboards the burdens of decision making, contributor obligations, grievances and other potential liabilities from the DAO. There is also a motivation for fairness. It would be unfair for a contributor to be penalised based on where they live or where they were born because the uncertain treatment of grants from a DAO will differ depending upon where it is received. The source and purpose of the grant is overcome by using an association. This new proposal is consistent with the progressive decentralisation process towards a permissionless contributor-driven DAO discussed in the [recent budget proposal]([link]) Specification. The associations framework of the TRP was arrived at after surveying the existing contributor LDO arrangements with a view to harmonising them, and surveying similar programs at other DAOs. Contributors with prior LDO grant arrangements were contacted and given a choice to either remain with their legacy arrangements, or to agree to terminate their old arrangement and elect to participate in the new framework of this proposal. Nearly all contributors agreed to elect to participate in the new framework. The goals of the TRP are: a simple single harmonised arrangement to enhance decentralisation by enabling contributors to accumulate LDO to vote in DAO governance. that grants are not measured by or dependent on hours worked, production or efficiency. that participation is optional; The TRP has the following elements: Term: four years, beginning on November 1st, 2022 for existing contributors Milestones: all participants will have a one year milestone before the rewards unlock, thereafter they will unlock gradually Participant: is a contributor who is eligible to receive LDO under the framework and who has been assigned a contributor level. Base Compensation: Base Fees, in US dollars Level-Multiplier: Based on experience and skill LDO Price: Calculated as the trailing 180-day close price of LDO, using the following[Dune query]([link]) as the source of truth Repricing Mechanism: Allows the contributor to manually trigger a reset of their TRP and milestone schedule, locking in a new LDO Price at the 180-day moving average, but forfeiting any accrued but not received LDO. For example, if a participant decided to reprice their TRP four months into the plan, they would lose all LDO accrued during those four months, and reset their milestone date to 12 months from the date the repricing mechanism was used. Upon being used, a new four year plan with a one year milestone is granted, and if a participant has multiple packages due to changes in roles or promotions as defined below - all are reset and consolidated into one new package. The maximum discount that participants can reprice at is 50% below the original TRP package price. The initial participant list is composed of the current DAO contributors as of November 1st, 2022, who are either working for the DAO directly or assigned to a DAO project from a contractor with a statement of work or agreement or snapshot, whichever the case may be (please see [proposal to form RCC]([link]), [Lido-1 budget request]([link])) The members of the above-mentioned not-for-profit grants association will form a commission which will be in power to qualify TRP to contributors, which it assesses to be most helpful in relation to Lido DAO, making them eligible for TRP. The commission will also be responsible to set each contributor a corresponding level in the TRP as described more fully in the section below. Note - participants are only allowed to reprice their package once per four years. Contributor Levels & Skill-Multiplier % > Lifeguard: 800%, or 200% per year. > Orca: 400%, or 100% per year. > Shark: 300%, or 75% per year. > Dolphin: 250%, or 62.5% per year. > Otter: 125%, or 31.25% per year. > Swordfish: 75%, or 18.75% per year. Policy Features Participants had the option to opt into the new Rewards plan, at the 11/1/22 LDO Price of 1.5294 or continue with their existing plan. This option lasted for two weeks from December 6th to December 20th. As mentioned above, this election by contributors was complete and understood to be conditional upon the approval of the LDO donation. Opting into the new plan enables participants to lock in the current LDO Price and retain their current milestone date. Please examples [in the original post]([link]) Note - Participant opting into new plan will receive pro-rata to the day for LDO accrued (e.g. If a contributor has contributed for 7.4 months, they will be received LDO at a daily rate and their first year milestone date will be remain unchanged at 4.6 months in the future) New packages will only be granted upon new contracts, hires, promotions, and base compensation increases of 30% or higher. A promotion is defined as a change in contributor level, i.e. from Shark to Orca. In the event of a promotion, if the amount of LDO is less than or equal to the amount under the previous arrangement, the participant will receive a +33% increase in LDO terms to compensate for the difference as a one-time change to the base level in terms of single promotion (the same 33% increase may occur during next promotion) If a participant is given a 30%+ raise but is not promoted, the undelivered portion of their TRP will recalculate at the original LDO price with no change to the milestone schedule A contributor voluntarily or involuntarily leaving the DAO will cease to be a participant. The TRP will continue until the budget is spent New program start, changes in formula of TRP calculation or LDOs required above the 22M LDO ceiling - will require a renewed DAO approval; Promotions will result in an incremental package granted to the participant for the difference between the existing package and new level package, at the LDO Price at time of promotion, capped at the annual amount of the new level package, with a floor that is at least equal to 33% of the promotion LDO TRP package. Additional detailed examples of calculations and applying the formulas of the framework are in the link to the Snapshot. The Association. The association will be resident in Switzerland. The purpose of the association is to own the multisig, audit and ensure contributor grants are matched to participant eligibility and to own all aspects of the TRP. This will offload obligations to contributors and any grievances to a single purpose third party. The use of the association will enhance trust that the gifted LDO is being used for the purpose of the association and enhance fairness and strengthen confidence with participants. The entity will be able to supply appropriate documentation to contributors who may face local challenges, something the DAO cannot do. The decisions of the association with respect to the TRP will be final. The association will: Use a 4/7 [safe.global]([link]) multi-signature wallet to execute the objects of the program; Implement, where feasible, automation which should include the deployment of a smart contract for each participant Make recommendations to the DAO, from time to time, regarding TRP Rotate Members of the multisig to ensure the continuity of the association. Own obligations, commitments, disputes and grievances with participants. Use EasyTrack motions to request refill top ups within the budget. Make bylaws and policies to give effect to the TRP. Under this framework the DAO will approve a donation to the association and the association will exercise discretion the TRP. This control to be executed via Aragon vote or equivalent governance instrument that might come to replace it in the future.

The estimated budget for this program +50% buffer for future changes (newcomers, possible changes in rewards level, etc.) is 22M LDO for the period from 1 November 2022 to 30 October 2026. The TRP multisig to be refilled in batches to individual smart contracts of each TRP participant in the whole planned amount, until all participants opting into the rewards plan get their contracts. Amounts in smart contracts will be unlocked to participants gradually according to the program schedule. The multisig committee should also be available to send funds to individual participants wallets before smart contracts deployment, if rewards are due. Part of these tokens may be used for disbursement of amounts for November 2022 - February 2022 period via RCC, ATC and PML (in addition to Lido-1 budget proposal), until the TRP ms is wrapped into a legal entity and smart contracts are deployed. This Snapshot approves this budget, TRP association creation and a transfer of LDO to its' multisig.

[Aave v3 is set to be deployed this coming week]([link]) without BAL being listed, however we expected it will be added in time given the nature of the relationship between the two communities. Motivation. After reading the [Karpatkey proposal]([link]) and learning that managing BAL falls outside of the defined remit, we would like to suggest that BAL be deposited into Aave v3 markets to earn yield. The graphic below shows that BAL yield can be very high at times and is consistently above 5% ![[image]]([link]) ![[image]]([link]) Currently, there is the ability to deposit up to another 44.5k BAL into the BAL Reserve on Polygon v3 before the SupplyCap on the Reserve is reached. Utilization within the BAL Reserve, 46.25%, is around the Uoptimal value, 45%,which indicates strong demand for BAL. Any small increase in utilization will lead to a noticeable jump in deposit and borrow rates. ![[image]]([link]) [This proposal]([link]) by Llama intends to increase the utilization of the Reserver, increase the yield that flows to deposits and reduce the variance in the deposit and borrow rates. It is worth noting that there is no proposed increase to the SupplyCap which means another proposal would need to be submitted on Aave to enable additional deposits into the Reserve. This favours moving sooner before the upgrade to increase borrowing rates goes live. Balancer is currently supplying 41.65% of the liquidity into the Reserve and given Balancer has a long term view, evident by the duration of the current deposits, there are no perceived issues with being able to withdraw a portion of these funds at any time. The difference between the SupplyCap and BorrowCap on the Reserve acts to make liquidity available to users who wish to withdraw funds when the Reserve is at max deposits and max borrowings, 28.5k BAL when proposal linked above is implemented. This exit liquidity is something Balancer needs to consider, it could lead to needing to withdraw funds gradually over time. Given the long term view and amount of BAL held by the DAO, this is very manageable and definitely worth considering. ![[image]]([link]) ![[image]]([link]) Specification.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

See for yourself in [these pre-made multicalls]([link]) that save leverage users time.

Since the time of UST and FTT, which had a large share among MIM collateral assets, their current composition looks much much better: [MIM Dashboard]([link]) With that being said, the protocol could be argued to still have potentially about 5.5% bad debt. Therefore, the max LTV for LP tokens is set up at 85, leaving a good gap for liquidations. 85 LTV max leverage and why 80 on others. The LP tokens in Curve and Convex have much less volatility compared to a regular MIM as an asset. Moreover, that will likely be the final destination for gearbox leverage users. As such, having higher LTVs for LP tokens while lower LTV allows for great leverage farming yet not over-exposing to risks. This would allow for 5x+ farming with yet a safe-enough Health Factor.

Both pools drive significant value to veBAL holders, both through fees earned as well as third parties pairing against OHM to route into these pools (e.g. BTRFLY, FDT, BOND) It is our intention to keep growing the number and size of OHM pools with new partners and we want to continue to host these pools on Balancer. >As part of a new product launch, Olympus DAO would like to request a gauge for the recently deployed OHM/wstETH pool. >The newly launched product is a novel liquidity solution that allows for effective scaling of select LSDs and stablecoins in an OHM pair. In a nutshell, this liquidity vault accepts third party deposits of LSDs or stablecoins and mints an equivalent amount of protocol-owned OHM against this as a counter asset. The OHM side of the LP does not accrue any rewards, so it cuts down the incentivization costs by half for partners. >The first liquidity vault will be launched in collaboration with Lido to create a OHM/wstETH pool. Specifications: 1. Governance: OlympusDAO is currently using snapshot for governance: [Link to Snapshot]([link]) DAO[multisig]([link]) 4 of 8: Holds DAO funds, executes governance proposals Policy[multisig]([link]) 3 of 5: Changes to policy (reward rate adjustments, turn on/off bond markets) 2. Oracles: The core protocol uses the Chainlink OHM oracle to record the OHM moving average price on chain for RBS operations (see [here]([link])) Other core protocol functions do not require oracles. The newly launched liquidity vault product uses the Chainlink (w)stETH oracle in order to prevent attack vectors in which deposits/withdrawals of the OHM/wstETH pool would result in highly skewed pool prices in comparison to the oracle price. 3. Audits: [Audit reports]([link]) 4. Centralization vectors: No centralization vectors. 5. Market History & Value: The current OHM POL pools on Balancer, [OHM/DAI]([link]) and [OHM/ETH]([link]), are some of the highest volume and fee driving pools for veBAL holders. On top, there are also partner pools for [OHM/BTRFLY]([link]) and [OHM/BOND]([link]) We expect the new OHM/wstETH pool to significantly contribute as well due to the protocol fee on yield assets as well as arbing between the different OHM pools. If this new liquidity product proves to be successful, our intention is to launch other LSD/stablecoin OHM pools in the Balancer ecosystem that will continue to drive value to both the protocol and veBAL holders. Please note: the OHM/wstETH pool has been deployed with the Olympus DAO multisig as the pool owner. Since this pool will be the first deployment for the new liquidity product described earlier, there might be a need - depending on the performance of the pool - to experiment with different fee setting to ensure optimal results for both the pool and the liquidity product.

This proposal will grant authority to the leaders of the Product and Engineering Workstream to implement optional, opt-out donations for any features offered in the ShapeShift App. The optional donations will be clearly visible in the UI (not hidden), and users will have the option to save their preference on their device. As long as both the Product and Engineering workstream leader agree, they will have the power and flexibility to implement these donations however they determine is in the best interest of the DAO until this authority is revoked. Abstract. This proposal was created as a counter proposal to [Added fees for Thorchain swaps]([link]) Currently, ShapeShifts application ([link] or [link]) is an open-source public good that does not add any additional fees onto protocols or services that it integrates. As one alternative business model, the DAO has established affiliate revenue relationships with multiple partners including fiat on/off ramps, DEXs, Name services, Yield aggregators, swag stores, hardware wallets, and validator operators. Once ShapeShift finds product market fit and attracts more users, this model could enable ShapeShifts application to remain free forever and generate more than enough revenues to cover expenses and fund growth. ![No fees + FOX [image]]([link]) \"Free is a [powerful concept]([link]) in and of itself, and the community has the unique opportunity to take this one step further by not only not adding fees, but also sustainably rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO via their activities in the app with FOX tokens. This could be a disruptively powerful model that could make ShapeShift objectively the best way to use a growing number of crypto protocols and services. This is a model in which users would have to be crazy to not use ShapeShift. This is a model that makes me bullish on the ShapeShift communitys ability to buidl the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe and cultivate unstoppable/unforkable network effects. I talk about this model in depth in this presentation from ETHDenver 2021: [link] While the DAO is actively generating ~$10k/mo via the affiliate revenue model, current operating expenses are closer to $200k/mo, and the DAO is not profitable with current usage levels and market conditions. With the hope of extending runway and one day being profitable, a proposal has been made to experiment with adding fees onto protocols that ShapeShift integrates. While this proposal has positive intentions to increase the chances of ShapeShifts survival and success, multiple community members and contributors have expressed concerns that adding any fees could have the opposite effect. To summarize some of the arguments against the fee experiment: Fees alone are not a solution. Ultimately the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users, and fees make it more difficult to attract and retain users. An experiment is not needed to prove that users would prefer not to pay fees, and it will be difficult to draw any conclusive results from the experiment. If usage did increase with fees, how could one know how much usage there would be without fees? Pursuing grant funding for integrating features that are already aligned with the DAOs roadmap has the potential to generate far more revenue than fees during the bear market, and abandoning the no-fee public good model could arguably harm the DAOs grant-fundability. To summarize the arguments for no fees: There is no issue with the current business model. Fees or no fees, the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users. By remaining free (or even better, being free and rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX), the DAO has the greatest potential to not only survive the bear market, but thrive, and achieve the communitys vision of building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe. In addition to fees being a race to the bottom, ShapeShifts application is entirely open-source. If the DAO did manage to achieve product market fit, it would be very easy and compelling for a single engineer to fork ShapeShift, launch their own governance token, and pursue the no fees + governance token reward strategy. If someone did this, their offering would be objectively better, and ShapeShift would be at a risk of a vampire attack, similar to when SushiSwap forked Uniswap and sucked out the majority of their TVL in the course of 1 week with minimal effort. This risk is not a fantasy, but the status quo; whenever any open-source protocol in Web3 realizes product market fit, these forks should be expected. With opt-out fees, the DAO would be in a better position to defend against this attack vector. The DAO has not yet attempted the no fee + FOX reward model, largely because it spent the first 1.5 years of its existence focused on rebuilding/open-sourcing the legacy application and architecting it for full decentralization. Before throwing in the towel and adding fees on top of decentralized protocols, the DAO should experiment with rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX tokens. Through the lively community debate(s) on whether or not to experiment with adding fees, a new idea emerged (h/t @graymachine and @hornyfox) to implement optional, opt-out donations. This is the same model that both Giveth and Gitcoin have implemented that enables them to generate revenue and build network effects without mandatory fees, arguably much more than they would generate with fees. For such a controversial, divisive topic, I see this proposal as a solid middle ground which satisfies many of both camps' desires while also alleviating many of their concerns. ![Optional donations - [image]]([link]) Motivation More valuable data: The data ShapeShift will get from whether or not users are opting-out of fees will give a good idea as to how much users really care about fees. On the other hand, if ShapeShift simply enables fees on THORChain swaps as currently proposed, it will be difficult to draw any conclusions. More public goodness - ShapeShift can remain a free, open-source public good, which is a powerful meme, particularly in Web3, and particularly as a community-owned DAO. It also doesn't require updating existing marketing messaging, and mitigates the risk of upsetting community members or users that were promised no fees forever.' More revenues: The opt-out approach has the potential to generate more revenues than mandatory fees, while also alienating fewer users. Further, this proposal grants authority to add opt-out donations to more features than just THORChain swaps, and also doesn't require removing existing affiliate revenue streams. If this proposal passes, ShapeShift could potentially offer opt-out donations, still generate affiliate revenues, and reward users that generate revenue for the DAO with FOX. Remaining as a public good could also support the DAOs efforts to continue securing grants. Less fees: Another motivation for this proposal is to offer a compelling alternative to adding mandatory fees and to buy time for the community to experiment with the no fees + FOX rewards model. Specification. The optional donations should be implemented in a way such that the donation amount is clear/not hidden, users can easily opt-out of donating, users can save their preference to opt-out locally on their devices, and no additional transactions are required from the user. This proposal is purposefully left vague to give flexibility to the Product and Engineering workstreams to implement the optional donations on whichever features and in whichever way they best see fit. Both the product (Diggy) and engineering ([hexadecimals]) workstream leaders expressed in the Incubation post that they are not worried about the lift nor UX implications and that if this proposal were to pass, their workstreams would do the necessary work. Benefits. 1. Increase revenues and runway. 2. Maximize user growth and retention/minimize user friction. 3. Maximize grant-fundability. 4. Maintain value prop of \"free, public good status, and meme-power. 5. Buy time to experiment with no fees + FOX rewards, which could help the DAO in achieving strong and defensible product market fit. Drawbacks. 1. Even though donations are optional, they could add a slight amount of friction to the UX relative to the current status quo of no fees nor opt-out donations. 2. Its possible that optional donations would result in less revenues than mandatory fees. 3. Mandatory fees would not be added to THORChain swaps, and the DAO would not be able to see the results of that fee experiment unless another proposal was passed in the future. Vote For: Implement optional, opt-out donations rather than mandatory fees Against: Do not implement optional, opt-out donations.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting, @dydymoon and @scottincrypto. Dated: 2023-01-11. Revised Date: 2023-01-31. --- Simple Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to update the CRV interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3, and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools. Abstract. The CRV SupplyCap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 24.66% with a Utilization of 47.76% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1] This proposal intends to increase the CRV SupplyCap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves. Capital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, increasing the Slope1 and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the reserves. Motivation. With the CRV reserve on Polygon reaching its SupplyCap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the SupplyCap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand. Llama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 70% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves. !([link]]) !([link]]) Specific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 70% will lead to an increase in the BorrowCap, which is a function of the SupplyCap and Uoptimal parameter. BorrowCap = SupplyCap (Uoptimal + 0.1) The new SupplyCap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24K. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 900.19K, [2] With borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments. ![|602x220]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) ![|602x201]([link]) The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 24.66% on Polygon v3. !([link]]) This proposal recommends introducing a Base and increasing the Slope1 parameter to 3% and 14% respectively. This will lead to a substantial change to the current curve. However, the current borrow rate still exceeds the borrow rate at the Uoptimal utilization point. Over time, we will be able to monitor the reserve and amend the Slope1 parameter t to optimize for utilization and revenue generation for Aave. The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate. !([link]]) The Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments. Specification. The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.

If you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr. - 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new players, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives. - 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a passcode hidden in the gotchiverse. - These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play. - At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants. - There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops. - Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi. One question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And whats more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete. We have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community more players will come to test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi. One of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point.

Background: Sentiment is an undercollateralized credit protocol on Arbitrum, allowing borrowers to access up to 5x capital on their collateral value. (Put up whitelisted collateral -> borrow assets from lending pools, up to 5x collateral value) ![Arch [image]]([link]]) Borrowers are \"confined within a Sentiment \"account, but users have the ability to deploy borrowed capital within Sentiment-whitelisted yield strategies  such as a variety of Convex & Balancer LP tokens (FRAX/USDC for example), lending on Aave, wstETH, etc. (thus cannot run away with debt & account simply fully liquidated when health factor < 1.2 ((debt + collateral value)/debt owed) An example of a strategy users can deploy using Sentiment is: 1. Deposit 100 $FRAX as collateral. 2. Borrow 500 $FRAX as debt. 3. Deploy into FRAX/USDC Curve Pool. 4. Earn 5x rewards APY from Curve pool and Gauge. Motivation: While using Sentiment for various strategies has worked in an extremely robust fashion (over $8mm in volume since inception, with the majority coming from stablecoin borrowing  depositing in Convex stable LPs), its definitely been tougher to attract lenders due to inherent risk/yield misalignment at the moment, especially given lenders on Sentiment currently cannot borrow against their lent assets, and Sentiment currently does not have a protocol token, thus no direct liquidity mining. As such, we're pursuing a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending market (LFRAX) in order to bolster more liquidity (already have an OTC bribe set up) Having a Frax gauge can allow us to incentivize more liquidity, which would create more available FRAX to borrow at a lower interest rate than other stables on our platform. Borrowers will then be able to deposit FRAX in FRAXBP and other FRAX-native yield strategies we hope to integrate in the future. This could create net deeper FRAX liquidity on Arbitrum! Proposal We would live for Sentiment to have a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending pool.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Neon EVM Devnet. Proposal. To support Aaves multichain expansion, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to Neon EVM on behalf of the community. Neon EVM is a first-of-kind EVM-compatibility solution for the Solana blockchain. The tool allows Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on Solana, allowing Ethereum dApp developers to leverage their knowledge of Solidity, developer tooling, and existing codebases to scale with Solana, which lets dApps take advantage of the best features from both blockchains. Neon EVM offers Ethereum ecosystem dApp developers increased throughput and swift block time on Solana, with low gas prices and no need for changing code  anyone can run Ethereum contracts on Solana with Neon EVM. It also introduces incentivised transactions-facilitating Neon EVM operators to the Solana blockchain. Neon Operator runs Neon Proxy servers, which helps facilitate seamless execution of Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. This allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with no code change. Neon is here to foster friendship between both communities and chains by adopting the developer tools and compute layer present on Ethereum and reducing friction for Ethereum developers looking to expand to Solana. Neon EVM ecosystem has numerous projects in its pipeline committed to launching during mainnet and shortly after the launch of mainnet, including blue-chip DeFi protocols, wallets, fiat on/off ramps, infrastructure, DAO tooling, etc. Committed to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, Neon Foundation will provide following support levels that include but are not limited to: Ecosystem Grants (Application/Approval based) Ambassador Program (Application/Approval based) Bounty Program (Application/Approval based) Ecosystem Funds (Application/Approval based) Neon EVM is a trustless and open-source project, which will be governed by DAO and Neon Foundation is committed to ethos of decentralisation and community ownership. As we are paving the path towards the open economy, it is highly imperative to have trusted and established lending & borrowing protocols such as Aave within our ecosystem. We believe that Neon-Aave integration will provide users with more choices, enable users to tap into distinct ecosystems from both sides and contribute to the expansion of Web3 economy. Deploying on Neon EVM will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum, taking advantage of Solanas throughput, and enabling users to tap into Solanas liquidity and the overall ecosystem. Neon EVM has a robust and surging DeFi ecosystem with distinct players such as AMMs, lending & borrowing protocols, derivatives etc. Having a flagship protocol like Aave would be highly valuable to our ecosystem; since we both share similar values when it comes to decentralisation and community ownership. Neon EVM is highly open to work together with the Aave community to determine optimal strategies for liquidity incentivisation, marketing, awareness campaigns, technical support and additional benefits that are tremendously important for both communities. The Neon Foundation team would like to take this opportunity and thank the Aave community for granting us the opportunity to make this proposal and we look forward to onboarding Aave to the Neon EVM ecosystem and building a long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationship.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOGeDr6NJrRnJsX5MngnfHGf7kjr", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954136, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Devnet.

Summary. Llama with support from Gauntlet proposes upgrading the MaticX Reserve on Polygon to facilitate an expansion of the MaticX/wMATIC loop strategy with the introduction of rewards. Abstract. The utilisation of the MaticX reserve has been trending higher over time and with the introduction of deposit rewards, there is an expectation the SupplyCap will be reached prohibiting additional MaticX from being deposited. Increasing the SupplyCap enables the recursive MaticX/wMATIC strategy to grow beyond the current constraints. Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. This proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. Motivation. Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

Abstract. BAL is a strategic asset to Aave and any BAL earned from the pool could be used by Aave to bootstrap the adoption of GHO and/or the new aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies. The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post]([link]) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.

Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote. Motivation. Listing BAL as a priority for Aave v3 reflects the strategic relationship between the two communities. Balancer and Aave completed a [200,000 BAL for AAVE token swap]([link]) and Aave later purchased an additional [100,000 BAL via a swap contract]([link]) With the launch of [GHO]([link])getting closer and the [new aToken]([link]) from @AaveCompanies currently in queue for audit, the potential use cases for veBAL are numerous.

Protocol Descriptions: MAI. MAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. A detailed list of collaterals and risk profiles can be found [here]([link]) MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022. MAI currently maintains pools on Balancers Ethereum and Polygon deployments. gDAI. gDAI is a receipt token for DAI deposits on Gains Network. DAI is used by gTrade users to perform trading activities. gDAI depositors act as counterparty facilitators to trades on gTrade. Gains Network is a leading defi platform on both Polygon and Arbitrum. The protocol leads rankings as one of the most profitable in defi. Motivation: Gains Network has seen impressive growth since its launch on Arbitrum. Demand for gDAI liquidity is high and so far untapped. For this reason, adding a pool for gDAI is a significant opportunity for Balancer to grow on Arbitrum. This pool will also represent MAIs main liquidity hub on Arbitrum. As such, it will take most of the volume related to liquidations and leverage. Specifications: Governance: Provide current information on the protocols governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain. MAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: link in reply. There is currently no governance process at Gains Network. A timelock of 2 weeks is in place. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol. MAI uses Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices. MAI: The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: link in reply gDAI: Seen the audit for Gains here: link in reply Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector. MAI: The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members. Gains: The protocol is run in a decentralized way, with changes made to the protocol being secured under a 2-week timelock. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pools gauge. MAI is one of the most stable decentralized stablecoins and has remained with the peg range for almost 2 years. Below is a chart of normalized volatility for MAI vs peer stablecoins: ![[image]]([link]) The price of gDAI is largely stable, as the underlying asset is DAI. The price of gDAI fluctuates in correlation to its collateral to debt ratio.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nCo-authored by: Burns, 0xYtocin. Keywords. Governance, PSP 2.0, Accountability, Rewards, Staking. Simple Summary. This proposal clarifies the roles, responsibilities, and membership of the Governance Committee contributors. This governance committee will be in charge of ensuring that the PSP rewards distribution is working as intended, and will meet regularly to monitor this. Context. First [introduced in the PSP 2.0 proposal]([link]), the role of the Governance Committee (or GovCo) is to ensure that the systems being introduced remain fair and unbiased, as well as execute Emergency Measures in case a key vulnerability is found (which are exemplified later in the proposal) This proposal seeks to expand this into a more detailed framework, exploring the structure of GovCo, the responsibilities of members, as well as a list of potential members to be nominated for the first iteration of the committee. Additionally, the proposal introduces a framework for further decentralizing the structure of the DAO in the future, such as the trial of the ParaTroopers' contributor system. With the passing of this proposal, the ParaSwap DAO will be equipped with contributors able to monitor the successful implementation of PSP 2.0, which will be needed to accomplish the required goals set in the initial trial period outlined in the proposal. Additionally, this proposal will permit for the experimentation of a contributor-based distribution system. Goals. The main goals of the proposed Governance Committee are as follows: Ensure that the Social Escrow system and PSP 2.0 reforms are working as intended When applicable, monitor and report potential vulnerabilities or unintended uses of the Social Escrow PSP system, and trigger Emergency Measures if necessary. Report suggestions, improvements, and ideas to the DAO about the Social Escrow staking and reward systems associated with it (meaning revenue redistribution + gas refund rewards) Implement bi-epoch checkpoints where the Governance Committee will discuss PSP 2.0 implementation updates, correct rewards distribution, and potential improvements. During the end-of-epoch checkpoint, ensure that the rewards are effectively distributed as established in past meetings by the Committee. Meanwhile, the main goal of the ParaTroopers pilot programme will be to experiment on a framework for a DAO contributor structure. In addition to experimenting with the format of Coordinape, this section of the proposal will also serve to clarify the objectives and vetting process of the first members of the system. Means I - Structure and Responsibilities of the Governance Committee. Meeting Sessions. Committee members will be expected to meet regularly every half epoch to discuss progress and findings with other members of the Governance Committee. In addition to these compulsory meetings, depending on the urgency of the matters discussed in the last meeting, the Committee can agree to hold an additional session during the off weeks. Duties of the meetings: Review data analytics of current performances of the sePSP system: Staking rates, staker boost performance, gas refund, reward distribution, etc. Suggest changes to the current system if necessary. Evaluate whether any actors might be acting maliciously (eg exploiting the ParaBoost system for personal gain) Ensure the distribution of rewards after an Epoch End. Emergency and Safeguarding. From the PSP 2.0 proposal, GovCo can decide to implement two kinds of emergency motions, depending on the severity of the issue reported: Tier 1 Type: Emergency. Scope: User funds are at risk. Actions: Immediate intervention by pausing the system, then a community discussion + vote for further actions. Only GovCo can pause the contracts and should release a postmortem. Tier 2 Type: Emergency. Scope: Risk on Revenue takeover (egg: Attack on the rev share by exploiting a loophole on the ParaBoost) Actions: 24h vote time. If the attack happens 24h before the fee distribution time, the reaction should be immediate and follows the same process as Tier-1. The action should be limited to pausing fee distributions. In addition to these two emergency powers, the Governance Committee is encouraged to express other non-emergency concerns they might have about the way the system is running during one of the regular sessions. Finally, in case any of these vulnerabilities were reported by an outside party, the Governance Committee is entitled to manage the PSP bounty present in the [Hats.Finance vault]([link])if deemed necessary. Vulnerabilities reported from within the committee will be entitled to the bonus Participation reward. Participation Rewards. We expect committee members to devote a significant amount of time to the Governance Committee, which we understand is a big commitment, as all current candidates are also members of other projects in DeFi. Because of this, we recommend that assuming all accountability measures are fulfilled, each seat is entitled to up to the equivalent of 1000 USD monthly in PSP per epoch after fulfilling all expected basic duties Payment will be sent to users after three epochs of participation in the program. The USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price. Additionally, GovCo members who report a vulnerability will receive up to the equivalent of 1000 USD in PSP in the epoch the vulnerability was reported. While we recommend for the Governance Committee to decide what constitutes a valid report, some examples of what could be considered a vulnerability include: Actions triggering Tier 1 or Tier 2 Emergency Proposals which, if executed, endanger user funds or revenue takeover. Other actions that may lead to the potential gaming of the Social Escrow System or ParaBoost. The member will be expected to present this vulnerability to the other Governance Committee seats, attaching any relevant information and figures and potential solutions. The USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price. Current Member Candidacy: As of the release of this proposal, the following members of the ParaSwap DAO and other DeFi protocols have expressed their interest in participating in the committee. In total, GovCo will aim to have 6 seats: Enerow Balancer Avantgarde Finance Paladin Pascal0x from Jarvis Protocol ParaSwap (technical) Finally, a core team member will hold a technical seat position, and they will be tasked in providing any technical assistance or information needed during the meetings, as well as initiating proposals. On Rotating and Protocol Seats. If a seat is clarified as a Rotating Seat', it means that the seat is assigned to a protocol rather than an individual, and the individual itself can potentially change at the discretion of the protocol. Regardless of the number of people representing this seat, they will still be entitled to only one vote. This process of seat rotation occurs purely on the Protocol side of things, and will only require a vote from the entirety of the Governance Committee if they wish to replace their protocol seat entirely (see the next section for more details) Seat Replacement and Additions. For security measures, the Governance Committee will always require at least five active seats for functioning, with a currently budgeted maximum of up to 8 seats. For the inclusion of a new GovCo seat, the candidates nomination will be discussed during one of the regular meetings, and afterward, a vote will be made regarding the inclusion. For the candidate to be included, a supermajority of at least two-thirds of all votes will be required. If a seat member wishes to stop being part of the Governance Council, they must give at least one whole epochs notice to allow member preparations. The seat member must then also assist in finding a replacement for the seat unless other Governance Committee members agree to reduce the number of seat members. Metrics - Accountability. Baseline Metrics Attendance threshold for each seat of at least 75% of the meetings mentioned in the Meeting Sessions' section. Ensure the proper distribution of rewards during the post-epoch reward period. Setting group KPIs after each meeting to resolve issues that might have been brought up during the session. Vulnerability Reporting Metrics - (Bonus Compensation Only) Provide a risk assessment and clear explanation of the issue being brought up Communicate during the GovCo meeting the issue found, with any relevant accompanying data or evidence. Means II - Introduction and planning of the ParaTroopers Contributor structure. Definition, Purpose, and Role. Part of the PSP 2.0 Trial period is to include a compensation structure to reward active community members in a contributor system dubbed ParaTroopers. These DAO contributors will be champions for ParaSwap with a mission to further the decentralization of the protocol and be responsible for: Being an interface for those looking to learn more or integrate with ParaSwap Protocol Assist with governance proposals before posting to the forum Provide technical support Manage contributors to the DAO and its surrounding community. Structure. As a first step in a compensation model, a Coordinape circle is to be set up with contributors delegating \"Give to each other in line with their levels of contribution for the epoch. The initial setup of the ParaTroopers contributor system is proposed to be a joint effort by Burns (Balancer Grants Co-lead) and Oxytocin (ParaSwap) to monitor and guide it through a trial period, with the intention of it becoming a self-sustaining group that continues to learn and evolve. Part of this will be defining communication processes, initial onboarding, setup tooling, and other general processes to create a sustainable system. A long-term goal is for specific DAO roles to emerge and be compensated accordingly, with the Coordinape circle serving as a \"bonus for long-term, highly engaged contributors and the possibility of immediate compensation for any new contributors. Genesis Onboarding. There is proposed to be ~5-10 initial ParaTroopers with this number to be assessed as the trial progresses. Onboarding for the founding ParaTroopers and the associated Coordinape circle will be via self-nomination through a submission form, followed by an interview by Burns and Oxytocin, to begin with, and then other ParaTroopers. Future additions will be via a case-by-case basis, nominated by one ParaTrooper and assessed by existing members. As this initiative is also part of the PSP2.0 trial period, the structures and processes of the system may be subject to major alteration and improvement as a result of further experimentation and iteration. At the end of the trial period, the ParaTrooper contributor system and its participants will be assessed by the community to determine whether to continue, iterate or dissolve the initiative. Participation Rewards. For the first epoch, the ParaTrooper Coordinape circle will have a max ceiling of $350 usd paid in PSP per contributor with the multiplier discussed below to be added on top. This would have a max budget of $5250 per epoch once max multiplier is reached after 3 epochs (10 paratroopers @ 1.5x) To encourage long-term holding and commitment to reducing token sell pressure amongst ParaTroopers, the trial will include an sePSP2 streak' compensation multiplier. This increases compensation for locking tokens for multiple epochs in a row, up to a maximum of 1.5x. However, if an unstake is made on the previous epoch, the streak will be lost and the compensation will revert to the standard rate. |Streak (of Epoches)|Multiplier| | --- | --- | |0|1.0x| |1|1.125x| |2|1.25x| |3+|1.5x| Examples: 1. If a contributor is awarded $350 USD by their peers through the Coordinape circle and has been staking continuously for the previous 3 full epochs, they will be compensated @ 1.5x = $525 paid in PSP . 2. The same contributor unstaked their sePSP2 in the last epoch or has no staked sePSP2, they will have a 1.0x multiplier = $350 USD in PSP. The USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price. Metrics - Accountability. Baseline Metrics Growth of Discord members, weekly communicators, and new member retention Qualitative increase in community communications Governance forum and voterparticipation Relationship between ParaTroopers and other DeFi communities. Forward Thinking Consideration - Further Decentralisation Steps of the DAO. This is the first step of decentralization, and a first-time experiment for the ParaSwap DAO. As the DAO matures, however, it is important to begin delegating more and more features to be running entirely through the DAO. In addition to the current Governance Positions, we could explore other methods of management from similar DAOs.

It follows the great feedback we got from the Proof of Concept presented in January and the SigProp that received the support of the DAO. This proposal aligns with the recent Aavegotchi Blog Post related to 2023 \"The Year of the Gotchi.\" We are convinced that having Aavegotchi in The Sandbox will bring exposure from a large user base to our ecosystem. >Bringing Aavegotchi into the Sandbox will contribute to achieving Aavegotchis three main focuses of 2023 : Player growth, Partnerships and Decentralization. As described in the DAO Discord Thread, we have an Aavegotchi IP Licence and are discussing the details of this partnership with The Sandbox but we already have some exclusive intel to share. The Alpha Season 4 is on its way (End Q2 2023) and Aavegotchi could be part of it if the DAO supports this initiative! With these Sandbox experiences, Aavegotchi DAO will be able to republish again for another Alpha season or in the future on their own lands. Please note these additions upon the feedback received from the SigProp and the most recent discussions with The Sandbox: - Maintenance and Updates: The SigProp mentions \"New updates or features to be added after those releases are out of this scope of work.\" This point will evolve regarding the last discussions we had with The Sandbox and expectations from DAO members. We got the confirmation that the time between the Alpha season 4 with experiences v0.8 (Q2 on sandbox lands) and the expected date for Land owners to be able to release experiences on their own lands shouldn't be too far from each other. Thats the reason this proposal includes maintenance and updates until Aavegotchi DAO is willing to publish its own experiences on land (1 Major Gamemaker version update to 0.9 ie) As 0.8 just went out, Sandbox confirmed that the next release isn't right around the corner. - Ownership: As explained in Hangouts and DAO calls with the community, the GFA does not claim the ownership of any asset or account used / created in this whole process. The limited license agreement entrusts the GFA team to create and use digital assets based on Aavegotchi intellectual property (10% royalty to PC) All source files from asset creations (VXM / . VXR / .) and credentials of the Sandbox account (dedicated account) are licensed for a specified purpose and scope: the development and maintenance of our Sandbox Aavegotchi experience. This proposal will also lead to some returns upon: - Marketing Strategy (Ownership and specific tokens/assets) for experienced players (Gotchis i.e.) - Aavegotchi and Sandbox project Aura and community. - Incentivized events (cross universe/easter eggs/enigmas/contests/leaderboard/prize pools/Twitch Live/AMA/Crew3 quests) - Avatars / Wearables Sales (5% commission to Sandbox) - Original Assets sales This Core Proposal is to fund 195k GHST and launch the creation of 2 Aavegotchi Experiences in the next 4 months as per: - The production costs. - The side Costs (Project management tool licenses / Promotion / Creation process events / Sandbox Grant discussions and negotiations) - Incentives (In-game and Cross-Universe) Those costs cover 2 experiences: - A single player game on a 2x2 land with multiple layers dedicated to Aavegotchi environments. - A multiplayer game on a 1x1 land with multiple layers. We will start to work on these 2 experiences right after this voting session if the DAO supports it. >A detailed funding request is available here if you missed it in the DAO Thread : [link]] We are proposing a split funding with DAI & GHST from the treasury holdings (900k DAI and 4M GHST) : > 95k GHST + 110k DAI (rate : 1 GHST = $1.10) The idea is to limit the selling pressure on GHST for the production compensation part. This would be 2 payments operated by the DAO Fondation. The release would be settled this way: > 50% at start (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI) 50% mid-journey (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI) Mid-journey achievements to be judged would be based on The Sandbox milestones already settled in the timeline to be signed in order to be ready for the end of Q2 2023. The Beta Version is planned for the beginning of May and is the milestone to be considered. According to our contracts PC + Sandbox would judge the quality of that mid term release.

On Ethereum: - [LUSD-3CRV Curve LP token]([link]) staked on Convex or StakeDAO. - [Curve 3CRV (USDT+DAI+USDC)]([link]) LP token staked on Convex or StakeDAO. On Arbitrum: - [Curve 2 Pool (USDC+USDT)]([link]) staked on Convex or StakeDAO. In total this makes 6 new different collateral assets (since each collateral is deployed for Convex and StakeDAO) Context. Angle recently added support for productive assets earning a yield as a collateral for agEUR with Convex and Stake DAO FRAXBP as the first supported assets for the token. As demand has been quite high for borrowing from our first LP token, it may be time to consider adding support from other assets, especially on other chains since the protocol is built to be chain agnostic. Proposal. The proposal is to add the collateral assets mentioned on Ethereum and Arbitrum. The parameters to use for these 6 new collateral assets can be found in this[PR]([link]) They are relatively close to the parameters used for[FRAXBP]([link]), but with a higher maximum discount on LUSD3CRV and 2CRV (Arbitrum) as both underlying collaterals could be less liquid than[FRAXBP]([link])underlying tokens. Implementation. With the work that has been done for FRAXBP launching new assets should be very straightforward. The idea is to use exactly the same infrastructure and smart contracts as what exists for FRAXBP. Value to the protocol. Angle will offer people a way to easily get a leverage on these tokens providing on average a >3% APR. Its important to note that users getting leveraged through this medium are not EURUSD neutral and doing so, they're essentially shorting the Euro and increasing their exposure on the dollar, so to offset for this risk, it makes sense to add assets as a collateral that can offer a pretty high yield (while still being liquid) There are very few protocols building on top of the proposed assets, so this gives extra flexibility to people who own these LP tokens but cannot do anything out of it: typically, they'll be able to borrow agEUR from tokens already earning a yield, and earning some incentives with agEUR. Risks. There are some risk considerations to have in mind when adding support for a new LP token as a collateral. The first one is that the price of the LP token shouldn't be manipulable. This implies having for each of the assets in a pool a Chainlink feed, which is the case for the 4 pools proposed. Underlying tokens should all have some liquidity with agEUR, which is something that is verified for each of them. We'll propose debt ceiling parameters and collateral factors accordingly with liquidity for each of the tokens. Its also important that liquidity for a token in the pool does not lie solely on this pool: for instance if you're having as a LP something like LUSD-3CRV and the only LUSD is in this pool, then it becomes risky to use the LP token as the value of LUSD is already dependent on the pool. In the end, its all a matter of how you can liquidate such assets used as a collateral. Liquidation infrastructure will be the same, and so liquidators will easily be able to tap into the proposed contracts to unpack a LP token to agEUR in a single transaction. On top of that, its going to be key to setup the risk parameters (debt ceiling collateral factors) to reduce to the maximum possible the risk of bad debt for the protocol. Voting Options. 1.

Dated: 2023-02-01. --- Summary. This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard CRV to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. CRV is a strategic asset to Aave and any CRV earned from the pool could be used by Aave to create veCRV for the purpose of bootstrapping the adoption of GHO, the new staked aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies and in the long term, might help incentivize the Safety Module too. The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post]([link]) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum. By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote. Motivation. Listing CRV on Aave v3 Ethereum compliments the communitys recent on-market purchase of CRV to [repay the excessive debt]([link]) created on v2 Ethereum. CRV is a material contributor to Aaves revenue through the continual borrowing demand for CRV. Month on Month revenue has fallen significantly as a result of disabling borrowing on the Ethereum v2 deployment. ![|602x361]([link]) There is strong ongoing borrowing demand for CRV due to the veTokenomics and the extrinsic use cases created by Convex Finance and projects built on top of veCRV. The chart below shows how freezing the CRV on [Polygon v2]([link]) and disabling boring on [Ethereum v2]([link]) during late November 2022 has affected deposit rates on Polygon v3. The Polygon v3 deployment is the only liquidity pool with Borrowing enabled, as a result there has been notable volatility in deposit rates. ![|602x193]([link]) By listing CRV on Ethereum v3, with Borrowing Enabled and a suitable BorrowCap users will have the ability to migrate from v2 to v3 and borrow CRV, generating revenue for Aave. Any CRV earned by Aave can be used to create veCRV, assuming Aave has access to the Curve voter escrow contract, which can then be used to vote CRV incentives to any combination of pools chosen by the community. How the CRV will be used is open for Aave to discuss and implement via a future proposal. For listing CRV, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations]([link]) post.

If we assume DYDX rewards are non-existent, how do we incentivize liquidity providers? Compared to its competitors, dYdX lacks a separate Market-Making Fee Program. This is arguably a result of the LP rewards program. However, as the number of markets, products, and competitors increases, the average reward per MM is expected to decrease with a fixed reward pool. Therefore, its imperative for dYdX to introduce a Market-Making Fee Program with rebates to naturally incentivize liquidity and reduce the reliance on rewards. The proposed Market-Making Fee Program as shown in Figure 5 consists of 5 tiers based on maker volume as a % of the 30D exchange volume on dYdX. Such a program with these proposed fee tiers is standard across most top-tier CEXs. As a result, MMs rewards are directly proportional to their maker volume and not bound by the size of the reward pool. Furthermore, by introducing a Market-Making Fee Program: MMs become more inelastic to changes in the current rewards program given rebates are more predictable and their reward surplus is now larger than before. The protocol now has a way to naturally incentivize liquidity, providing increased freedom when altering DYDX rewards.

Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting . Dated: 2023-02-03. --- Summary. @Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend the wAVAX interest rate parameters on the Aave Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Llama is working with Chaos Labs to revise the sAVAX risk parameters needed to enable more funds to flow into the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool. This proposal will focus on revising the AVAX interest rate parameters with the goal of improving the capital efficiency of the wAVAX reserve and increasing Aaves wAVAX revenue. With a revised higher SupplyCap on sAVAX, we expect this to lead to an increase in the adoption of the recursive yield strategy. Increasing the availability of wAVAX supports the growth in TVL and revenue accruing to Aave with the sAVAX SupplyCap becoming the primary means limiting the adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX. Motivation. Llama has been in discussions with various parties to develop a yield curve that supports adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3. The strategy is modelled to be attractive whilst the utilisation of the wAVAX reserve is less than the Uoptimal point. Interest Rate at the Uoptimal point is calculated as shown below. Base + Slope1 = 70% x (LST Yield + sAVAX Deposit Incentives / 2) / (98% x sAVAX eMode LTV) Base + Slope1 = 70% x (7.2% + 0.41% / 2) / (98% x 92.5%)) = 4.72% This approach reflects the following considerations: Deposit rewards on sAVAX significantly affect the profitability of the strategy by offsetting wAVAX borrowing costs. Yield earned is sAVAX yield (7.2%) + deposit incentives (0.41%) sAVAX deposit rewards are diluted with more deposits, ie: 50% growth in sAVAX deposits. Recursive strategy operates narrowly within the LTV of sAVAX eMode TVL. 98% of the 92.5% LTV via Avax Correlated eMode Recursive strategy is only attractive whilst generate supportive risk adjusted yield. Looping 6 times generates around double the LST yield at Uoptimal utilisation, this is how the 70% figure is derived. This does not takes into consideration leverage transaction costs which could lead up to 1.5% of the principle and incur a 2-3 week break even period. It is assume users stay within the strategy for an extended period of time. The current recursive strategy sAVAX/wAVAX is generating around 23.9% with a low wAVAX utilisation due to the SupplyCap for sAVAX has been reached. This yield will fall as the wAVAX utilisation increases. Assuming the SupplyCap for sAVAX is doubled, the current wAVAX interest rate curve becomes the limiting factor on the profitability of the strategy. The SupplyCap on wAVAX has a utilisation of 24.35% and offers considerable deposit capacity. There was no BorrowCap for wAVAX at the time this proposal was drafted. To reduce the volatility in the borrow rate between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal, a Base of 1% is introduced whilst keeping the Base + Slope1 interest rate as calculated above. This generates a Slope1 of 4.72% Adjusting the Uoptimal parameter improved the capital efficiency of the AVAX reserve. Adjusting from 45% to 65% is a substantial increase. The current utilisation is a lot lower, 28.49% and is expected to increase substantially, possibly 56.98% when the sAVAX SupplyCap is to be doubled. This is still short of the 65% Uoptimal parameter and offers users an attractive yield on the strategy. With future SupplyCap increases, the Uoptimal parameter can be revised. With a Uoptimal of 65%, there remain sufficient liquidity in the reserve to liquidate users. It is also worth noting a $5.055m USDC swap for wAVAX incurs a 2% price impact via 1inch. The Slope2 parameter has been reduced from 300% to 144.28% to generate a borrow rate of 150% at 100% utilisation. This reduced the volatility when utilisation is in the Uoptimal < Utilisation <100% range. When utilisation is in this range the recursive strategy is not generating sufficient reward relative to holding sAVAX and will lead to strategy reducing leverage and therefore utilisation of the wAVAX reserve. Because of this relationship a gradual increase in borrowing interest is preferable and thus a lower Slope2 parameter can be implemented. !([link]]) Specification. The following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama. |Parameter|Proposed Value| | --- | --- | |Variable Base|1.00%| |Uoptimal|65.00%| |Variable Slope1|4.72%| |Variable Slope2|144.28%| |Stable Borrowing |Disabled| |Stable Slope1 |4.72%| |Stable Slope2 |144.28%| |Base Stable Rate Offset |4%| |Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5%| |Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20%| Stable rates have been updated to mitigate any risk of enabling stable borrowing and having a variable borrow rate greater than the stable borrowing rate.

The circulating supply of BUSD will thus trend toward zero over time. This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to freeze BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Abstract. This ARFC proposes to freeze the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Motivation. While BUSD is not an asset with borrowing power, and recent development does not present risks of excess debt, From the 21st of February 2023, the circulating supply of this asset will eventually go toward zero. As theres no real prospect of growth and the inability to mint new BUSD might hurt peg arbitrage opportunity and asset peg. It seems that the most reasonable path for Aave is to freeze this reserve and invite users to switch to another stablecoin among the diversity present in Aave. As theres no immediate risk for the protocol, the ACI doesn't call for a fast-track process for this ARFC, and the standard governance process seems fit. Specification.

Delisting will also have negative consequences to the on chain volume for the STG token. Currently, the Stargate DAO owns almost all on chain liquidity and earns significant fees from trading activity that uses this liquidity. A portion of the activity is arbitrage between on chain liquidity and centralized exchanges. A lack of a robust centralized exchange pool results in less liquidity and decreases the ability for this arbitrage to happen and results in less fees earned by the DAO. Process: Numerous market makers were considered to bring forward one proposal that the community can vote on, if enough signal that this is interesting to do is given. The proposal will list details about the market maker, and some base details of their proposal. Due to competitive edge, not all details can be shared. If this advances to voting, the Stargate DAO will select one of two options: The first option is that the marketer maker proposed, GSR, will be chosen and the DAO will proceed with GSR as the market maker for STG. The second option is no market maker will be chosen, the proposal will be voted down and the DAO will proceed without a market maker for the foreseeable future. About GSR: GSR is a leading market maker, ecosystem partner, and active, multi-stage investor. In addition to the veteran traditional finance and derivatives background of its founders, GSR maintains an ethos of client service that is at the center of its offerings. With 250+ employees around the globe and a core engineering and trading focus, GSR uses nearly a decade of market data and crypto expertise to continuously refine and expand its trading engines and programmatic execution capabilities, with a focus on providing best-in-class service to projects across different stages of their development. Its trading technology is connected to 30+ exchanges, including major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols. GSR works with projects across the entire crypto ecosystem, and has considerable expertise across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space - with a particular focus on core infrastructure, security, and protocol levels. It has provided, at times, over US$1bn of liquidity a day to DeFi markets, while investing heavily in DeFi protocols across the Web3 ecosystem. Going beyond the breadth of its investments, integrations, and infrastructure, GSR is committed to being an active and reputable collaborator in the space, highlighted, in part, by the launch of GSRBlue: its marquee long-term NFT portfolio of well-known creators and projects. GSR is operating as normal and remains focused on maintaining liquidity for our clients despite the market events of last year. As standard practice we proactively manage our exposures to all exchanges and reduce dynamically where necessary. GSR is well-positioned to navigate the high volatility and continues to actively deploy capital to maintain healthy liquidity in both private and listed linear and nonlinear products in the space. Terms: The following terms can be shared about GSRs offer. Number of tokens requested: 8,000,000. Length of term: 24 months. Strike mechanism: European option ([link]) after 24 months at an average price greater than $1.15. The exact price is not shared to protect market integrity. A european option is an option that is not exercisable until the end of the term. The price of STG has to be over the price of the option to make it worth it for GSR to actually accept it. In this case GSR would return a cash equivalent to the DAO. If it is not over the strike, they will have market made STG for free, returning all tokens at the end of the term to the Stargate DAO. This aligns GSR with the long term success of Stargate protocol for the entire term of the agreement while providing much needed liquidity to the market. In this case, they are BUYING the STG tokens at that price in the option, i.e. if STG at the strike price they make $0 profit they only acquire tokens at fair market value which are worth exactly what they paid for them.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOGxU0kX9gNi8S7D5GogRcA80o6j", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954155, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Stargate DAO is considering engaging a market maker, GSR, to address liquidity issues with their token on centralized exchanges.

This proposal aims to add Adding the abstain option, in addition to \"Yes and \"No, allowing voters and delegates to participate in voting without having to take a side. Motivation. The current governance process of the 1inch DAO only allows members to vote Yes or No on proposals. This system can be limiting as it does not allow members to express their opinions accurately, particularly if they are unsure of the consequences of a proposal or do not have enough information to make a decision. Adding an Abstain option to the voting process will allow members to express their views more accurately and increase the overall transparency of the governance process. Specification.

(No) Against this proposal.|| (Abstain) Neither In favour nor Against. The Abstain Button is expected to be used in the following cases. Neutrality: The Abstain option allows members to remain neutral on a proposal and not take a stance, which can be useful when members are unsure of the proposals consequences or do not have enough information to decide. Higher Conflict of interest: As part of proposal hygiene, Authors of the proposals tend to abstain from voting on their proposals even though they act in the best interest of the DAO. Furthermore, Voters tend to abstain from voting if there is a high conflict of interests as a voter and the proposed implications. Insufficient information: In case a proposal is moved to snapshot with insufficient information or data, a voter can choose to abstain, thus signalling their unwillingness to decide without further information or discussion. The proposed changes will impact any existing quorums or the requirement to pass a proposal. Rationale.

GotchiID: 4563. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days. Final Discourse Thread: [link] Original Discourse Thread: [link] Allocation of the Curves DAI. In addition to derisking from reliance on MakerDAO and DAI, turning off the Curve is also an opportunity to secure significant funding for Aavegotchi development. So far, the DAI in the Curves contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curves closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol. This proposal is for the Curves DAI to be allocated to two main parties, AavegotchiDAO at 70% and Pixelcraft Studios at 30% This is to take place across three distinct multisig wallets, two of which are managed by AavegotchiDAO elected members while the third allocation goes to the founding team, Pixelcraft Studios, to continue development and advocacy for Aavegotchi protocol. Note: The numbers below were adjusted from the 20/40/40 split originally proposed, based on community feedback. AavegotchiDAO Liquidity Provisions (40%) 40% of the Curves collateral should immediately be directed to a DAO managed multisig specifically tasked with deepening liquidity on an agreed upon platform or platforms to help prevent extreme volatility in the moments following the closure of the Curve. There needs to be one or more places for people to enter and exit GHST with healthy liquidity. AavegotchiDAO will have to decide which platforms make the most sense to deploy on. I suggest that we consider creating a task force empowered to manage this liquidity while the decision of where to initially direct that liquidity could be signaled by the greater DAO at the same time. Examples include decentralized platforms like Quickswap and Uniswap but there is a case for traditional CEXs as well. In either case, Pixelcraft Studios can help to introduce AavegotchiDAO Foundation to trusted market makers or decision makers at the platforms being considered. If this proposal passes, AavegotchiDAO should set about deciding how to structure the receiving multisig and who will be responsible for signing, as well as strategies to put the funds to use ASAP. AavegotchiDAO Foundation (30%) The 9 members recently elected to sit on the AavegotchiDAO Foundation host the most obvious multisig wallet to receive and secure DAI on behalf of our DAOs treasury. The DAO can then opt to vote on a diversification strategy it believes is optimal, and the multisig Directors can carry out that plan. Remember, the 9 multisig signers were elected without any decision making power. The DAO at large will be responsible for appropriating funds from treasury via AGIPs, Taask Forces, or other future methods. Pixelcraft Studios (30%) Home of the Summoners of AavegotchiDAO and the creators of Aavegotchi, Pixelcraft Studios prides itself on being frugal, good stewards of the funds entrusted to it by the community. Our vision for 2023 and beyond is clear  to make Aavegotchi a well-known brand in the NFT gaming industry, and beyond that, an IP recognized around the world. As to how Pixelcraft Studios intends to use these funds, that can be broken down into seven distinct categories: 1. Ensuring relevant partners have sufficient working capital to maintain deep liquidity on CEXes partnering with Aavegotchi. 2. Increasing spending on outreach, tasteful marketing, and growth-oriented endeavors to ensure that our message is heard loud and clear in 2023. 3. Equipping our development and design teams with the staff and training they need to deliver on key roadmap items such as the Gotchiverse, Gotchi Guardians, and Gotchichain. 4. Derisking from potential stablecoin collapses by diversifying the DAI received into a variety of assets secured on Polygon, Ethereum, and Bitcoin chains, with a small percentage also stored offchain to pay for real-world expenses. 5. Launching an Aavegotchi builders program to incentivize talent to build on Aavegotchi and fast-tracking the IP licensing process. 6. Donating to registered charities that align with the shared vision and mission of the Aavegotchi community and Pixelcraft Studios. 7. Sponsoring and hosting IRL events to raise awareness of the Aavegotchi brand and form lasting connections with frens new and old in the meatspace. Notably, heres what we would NOT do: A. Use the funds to give bonuses or unnecessary raises to Pixelcraft Studios founders or team members. B. Spend the funds on frivolous, tasteless marketing that does not serve the Aavegotchi brand. C. Spend the funds on any endeavor or product not directly related to Aavegotchi. What if the DAO says no? If the DAO rejects the proposal to turn off the curve for whatever reason, we are pleased to say that Pixelcraft Studios is in fine financial condition, and our roadmap plans would not be significantly affected by this decision. All of the items published on our latest 2023 Roadmap, and also on previous roadmaps, are doable with our current treasury and burn rate, assuming that DAI does not experience the depeg we are worried about, and the market does not experience major black swans that massively wipe out all value in the crypto space. If the DAO votes to turn off the curve but decides not to allocate funds to Pixelcraft Studios, that is also fine with us, but we would hope it has a solid plan on how to handle a post-curve GHST ecosystem. Conclusion. This proposal advocates increasing funding to both major parties by putting the Curve token sales DAI to work on behalf of all GHST and Aavegotchi NFT holders. If you believe now is the time to go big, scale up operations and improve accessibility to GHST token, vote for this proposal.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOGw5PQHbIZJUtJnxqQqh4GNsr56", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954154, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests allocating the remaining DAI in the Curves contracts to support Aavegotchi development.

Furthermore, there are several benefits associated with enabling a gauge for TRYB/ USDC pool: > Increased Liquidity: Turkish traders will have access to deeper liquidity than before which should lead to lower spreads between buy/sell prices resulting in an improved trading performance. > Greater Accessibility: By including TRYB in the Balancer Protocol alongside other popular currencies like USDT and USDC, traders around the world, including Turkish traders, will have greater access to invest and manage their funds digitally through a well-respected decentralized finance protocol like Balancer. > Yields and Transaction Fees: While Turkish investors will be able to enjoy the benefits of utilizing Balancer in the most accessible manner; at the same time, Balancer will earn additional yields from fees collected from trading activities within the platform. BiLira will act as an on/off ramp for the community and they will benefit from Balancer directly.

Users can use the web application on [BiLira.co]([link]) to conduct TRYB issuances and redemptions between their local banks and their digital wallets. > >The minting of on-chain TRYB is from fully collateralized bank deposits. Users connect their wallets and deposit fiat currency (TRY) into BiLiras bank account. BiLira confirms the transaction and verifies the smart contract. The smart contract then mints corresponding TRYB tokens and sends them to the customers crypto wallet. Corresponding fiat currency is held in BiLiras reserves. This information can be verified through our audit reports that are done via 3 party firms.(link to the reports can be found below) Another factor is that BiLira doesn't hold the users crypto assets. The issuance process is non-custodial and the assets are sent to the users wallet addresses that they provide. For redemption, users send their TRYB to their BiLira redemption wallets, and convert the specified TRYB to Turkish Lira through [bilira.co]([link]) All of the redeemed TRYB from customers are burned in a monthly routine. BiLira firm uses enterprise-grade multi-layer security measures such as Multi-Sig wallets through Fireblocks. Motivation: > Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey is one of the highest in the world and continues to grow as a result of the increasing demand for digital assets and financial services. A survey by [ING]([link]) illustrates that almost 18% of Turkish people have used or owned cryptocurrency in some form, compared to 9% across the European Union. This has been driven by the high inflation rate and economic uncertainty that has been experienced in Turkey over the last few years. The Turkish Lira (TRY) has been especially severely impacted, with its value dropping by over 40% since the beginning of 2020. As a result, Turkish users actively seek for alternative financial instruments and solutions. By creating the [TRYB/USDC pool]([link]), we wanted to open the gates of Balancer to the Turkish DeFi users. > >With such a large base of crypto users, TRYB pools on Balancer would provide Turkish users with easy access to the decentralized finance ecosystem and make it easier for them to adopt and trade crypto assets. > >Furthermore, by incentivizing TRYB on Balancer there will be an incentive for users to provide liquidity and actively swap tokens. This will consequently result in more users joining the platform and increased trading volumes. As more of the Turkish community join and more people begin using TRYB tokens for their transactions or contribute to the relevant liquidity pool, traders will have more opportunities to arbitrage between different exchanges and earn profits from price discrepancies across markets.

Market History: TRYB has been on blockchains since early 2019. It has been listed and used on numerous DEXs and CEXs since its launch. Until today more than 5 billion TRYB has been issued by BiLira to fulfill the user demand. [See Coingecko history here.]([link]) From August 2020 and up until 31 October 2022, TRYB was within +/-1% of the peg 93.14% of the time and within +/-2% 98.90% of the time. There are some market places where there is lack of liquidity which does not make a sufficient impact on the peg. Outliers on the TRYB/TRY peg distribution rarely occur on these marketplaces with relatively less volume. However, TRYB peg is guaranteed with the TRY held in the bank account of BiLira.

The proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap. The cap is being decreased. The AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve. For other situations, the normal governance process is applicable. This framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools. Motivation: Supply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users. Given the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature. As a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.

' Simple Summary On February 7th 2023, the Barter Solver was hacked, causing the CoW settlement contract to lose a total of [$166,182.97]([link]) in funds (CoW Swaps accrued fees of the last 7 days) The Barter Solver had been added to CoW DAOs Solver Bonding Pool and was whitelisted 11 days prior to the incident. In line with [CIP-7]([link]) it is CoW DAOs responsibility to assess the damages caused and decide whether the bond should be slashed to make up for any incurred losses. In this case the hack and its cause and impact can clearly be identified, it is therefore proposed to slash CoW DAOs Bonding Pool in the size of the funds drained by the hack in order to refund the CoW settlement contract. It is important to note here that CoW DAOs Bonding Pool was created with help of CoW DAOs own funds. The rationale behind setting up CoW DAOs own Bonding Pool was to reduce the entry barrier for new solvers. Solvers have to undergo a vetting process before being added. The Barter Solver has been collaborative since the occurrence of the hack and already made a transfer of 166,300 USDC to COW DAOs Bonding Pool, covering the total amount proposed to be slashed in order to cover the incurred losses in the settlement contract. Motivation / Rationale CoW DAO is aware that the funds stored in the CoW settlement contract are exposed to some risks due to the nature of the solver competition: in order to ensure optimal execution, solvers are allowed to tap into the funds stored in the CoW settlement contract (called the \"buffers) to replace certain AMM interactions and thus save on gas, reduce execution risk and thus improve the overall user experience. In order to mitigate the risk of solvers exploiting their access to the buffers and thus causing financial losses to CoW DAO, solvers have to join a bonding pool before being allow-listed. This bonding pool mechanism was set up under [CIP-7]([link]), which requires solvers to deposit $500,000 worth of cUSDC and 1.5M COW tokens as collateral. In the event of malicious behavior or a hack, it is CoW DAOs responsibility to slash part of the solver bond to cover for the losses incurred. A list of the events in order of occurrence: The Barter Solver got whitelisted and added to the CoW Bonding Pool on Jan 27th ([tx link]([link])) Shortly after, the Barter Solver set an approval to a contract allowing arbitrary calls ([tx link]([link])), allowing for anyone to use this approval to transferFrom The Barter Solver noted security issues and therefore deployed a new contract which has no arbitrary execution code functionality built in ([link]([link])), but didn't clear the allowances set to the old contract Feb 7th, a hacker exploited the old contract and drained about $166K in funds from the settlement contract. ([link]([link])) Feb 7th, the Nomev Team, which is responsible for the handling of the settlement contract delegated by and on behalf of CoW DAO, revoked all approvals from the old contract and denylisted the Barter Solver Feb 7th, a few hours after the hack, the Barter Solver sent 166,300 USDC to the CoW Bonding Pool ([tx link]([link])) Based on the events and the collaboration of the Barter Solver in the aftermath of the hack, no malicious intent by the Barter Solver can be determined. However, due to the gross negligent failure of revoking previously set approvals by the Barter Solver, CoW DAO incurred financial losses of $166,183. It is therefore proposed to slash the bonding pool the Barter Solver is part of in the full amount of the funds lost in the hack and send those funds to the [Solver Rewards Safe]([link]) to cover the lack of fees withdrawn from that week. Though now having occurred for the first time, its important to stress that this is an intended process. Decentralization is insured by a diverse set of solvers and there should explicitly not be an entity controlling and overseeing each solvers strategies and blockchain interactions. The bonding pool and slashing set-up is the risk mitigation for letting every solver access the settlement contract, adding a lot of efficiency, in the interest of the users! Given the facts of the matter, the Barter Solver is free to rejoin the pool in case this proposal passes and the reimbursement process of both the CoW settlement contract and the CoW Bonding Pool is completed. Specification 1. Withdraw all USDC from Compound. 2. Claim COMP rewards. 3. Slash the CoW Bonding Pool by sending 166,183 USDC to the [Solver Rewards Safe]([link]) to refund the losses incurred by the hack. 4. Reinstantiate the bonding pool using 500k USDC (including 166,300 USDC compensation received from the Barter Solver), by depositing to Compound v2. This ensures that the requirements of CIP-7 are met and sufficient funding is available in the CoW Bonding Pool for the continuous operation of its participating solvers. 5.

' Simple Summary: We propose an auction based mechanism for rewarding winners of the solver competition. Currently, the winner of the solver competition is rewarded an amount of COW token based on the orders that are included in their solution. This per-order rewards model does not take into account general market conditions or how difficult it was to find a solution. It therefore requires constant readjustment and it does not incentivize research into tackling challenging batches, e.g., utilizing the value of CoWs. The proposed auction mechanism allows for dynamically finding a reward based on how much value a solver provides to users by settling a batch. This results in a distribution of rewards better aligned with goals of the protocol, solvers, and users. Motivation. The current reward scheme for the solver competition is based on risk adjusted rewards on a per-order basis as described in [CIP-14]([link]) There are several issues with the current model: It is parameterized by an ad-hoc minimum reward of 37 COW per order. It is oblivious to how easy it is to detect the best execution (thin vs thick competition) Auctions with multiple identical submitted solutions are rewarded the same as auctions with only one valid solution. It does not (as much as it should) reward innovation and taking advantage of CoWs and structurally better solutions (e.g., detecting CoWs vs execution with touching the same pool multiple times) It is oblivious to the volume of an order and the particular pairs traded. Ultimately, the current model is quite static, does not directly take protocol viability into consideration, and is not adaptive enough to the ever-changing competition landscape. The proposed reward mechanism results in an improvement of all those issues. It also requires some changes in the behavior of solvers. We will discuss those after the specification of the mechanism. Specification. Per-auction rewards are computed using a second-price auction mechanism for the quality of solutions: 1. Each solver commits to a score and a solution. 2. The winner is the solver with the highest score. 3. The winner gets to settle the auction on chain, and is payed. 'payment = cap(observedQuality - referenceScore)' Here, the observed quality is 'observedQuality = observedSurplus + observedFee', as executed on chain. The reference score is the second highest submitted score. The uncapped payment of 'observedQuality - referenceScore' is capped from above and below using the function 'cap(x) = max(-c, min(c + observedCost, x))' with a cap 'c' of '0.01 ETH' Submitted scores have to be positive. We note that the (protocol-submitted) empty solution, having a zero score, will always be considered in the ranking. This implies that an auction with only one submitted solution (from a solver) can still get rewarded (the referenceScore in this case is zero) The observed quality is zero if the settlement is not successfully submitted to the blockchain. This can be, e.g., due to a revert of the transaction or because the transaction was not successfully settled in time (current limit is 2 minutes) The payment described above can be decomposed into a reward and a gas reimbursement. In the case of a successful settlement, the gas reimbursement is equal to 'observedCost' of the settlement, while the reward is 'payment - observedCost' which is equal to 'min(observedQuality - observedCost - referenceScore, c)' For a failed transaction, the gas reimbursement is zero and the reward is negative and equal to 'max(-c, -referenceScore)', in which case the winning solver would have to pay the reward to the protocol. As before, gas reimbursements are payed in ETH while rewards are paid in COW, using an up to date COW price. The protocol commits to spend 20_000_000 COW tokens per year i.e. around 383307 COW per week on rewards. If at the end of an accounting period (currently: a week) the total amount of performance based rewards to be paid to solvers is smaller than the amount committed to by the protocol, the remaining sum is distributed to solver teams which consistently provide solutions. Those rewards will be distributed pro-rate to solvers based on the number of auctions they submitted a valid solution for over the accounting period. The capping of performance based rewards is chosen such that the total rewards for all solvers amount to around 15_000_000 COW tokens per year (see section on experiments) This is comparable to the rewards payed to solvers in Nov-Jan. The remaining COW tokens of the total allocation of 20_000_000 COW are rewarded based on consistency. The cap of 0.01ETH will be adjusted one time after 4 weeks of using the new reward scheme. If the amount of rewards payed in that period extrapolates to significantly more than 15_000_000 COW per year, the cap will be decreased. If the amount of rewards payed in that period extrapolates to significantly less than 15_000_000 COW per year, the cap will be increased. We will monitor the additional constraint score < observedQuality' for submitted scores and add this rule to the social consensus rules. Implications for solvers. With the new reward mechanism solver teams would have to submit not only their solution but also a score. The score can be interpreted as expected quality - expected costs. A profit maximizing solver would maximize their score, which in turn would mean that they maximize expected quality - expected costs. The second-price mechanism means that solvers would truthfully report this expectation. The change of the reward mechanism will thus require solvers to adapt their strategy a bit: Instead of just maximizing quality - costs they now explicitly have to take into account revert risks. This moves complexity to solvers, as proper risk management is going to be required to be profitable. The new reward scheme does not by itself enforce maximizing surplus of users. This is because in the score computation a smaller surplus of a solution can be compensated by a smaller cost e.g. due to positive slippage. We want to avoid the situation of solvers decreasing surplus and will therefore monitor and enforce EBBO (Ethereums Best Bid and Offer) rules more strictly, see the social consensus rules in [CIP-11]([link]) Transitioning period. Solvers have to learn to submit scores, e.g., by having a model for revert risk and costs. Therefore we propose a transitioning period for the new reward mechanism along the following lines: 1. Two weeks for a dry run of the new scheme where solvers can optionally submit either a score' or a scoreDicount' (at most one of the two values) All solutions are simulated and only successfully simulated solutions are considered. If a scoreDiscount' is submitted, the driver computes a score as score = simulatedSurplus + simulatedFees - simulatedCost - scoreDiscount' Solutions are still ranked and rewarded by the old scheme. Solvers can see how they would have been ranked and rewarded using the new scheme. This period will start on 28.2.2023 and with weekly payments computed on 7.3.2023 and 14.3.2023. 2. Four weeks of using the new scheme in production where submitting either a score' or a scoreDiscount' (exactly one of the two values) is mandatory. The ranking of solutions and rewards are computed using the new scheme. This period is used to observe the competition and the effect of capping. If rewards are significantly smaller than expected the cap is increased. If rewards are significantly larger than expected the cap is reduced. This period starts on 14.3.23 with the first payment to solvers taking place on the 21.3.2023. 3. After that period, the submission of a score' becomes mandatory. This period starts on the 11.04.2023 with the first payment being on the 18.04.2023. Experiments on historical data. The new reward scheme has been tested on historical auction data from October to January. Using the proposed scheme, the capping of rewards was chosen such that rewards are close to 41068 COW per day, corresponding to 15_000_000 COW per year, with a fixed exchange rate of 0.00005 ETH/COW. For October-January: ![rewards_vs_cap_oct-[image]]([link]) In the time period November-January the proposed scheme results in the following rewards for the individual solvers (blue: scheme old, yellow: new scheme) ![[image]]([link]) The script and data for the experiments can be found in the Appendix.

Additionally, we provide user position analysis below. Abstract. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

A proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for one (1) asset on Aave V2 Ethereum. Motivation. This proposal is a continuation of a[series of proposals]([link])([AIP-136]([link]),[AIP-137]([link])) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on V2 assets. At Chaos Labs, we continuously monitor markets and utilize our[Asset Protection Tool]([link])to assess potential attack vectors on the protocol and suggest parameter and configuration updates accordingly (Supply/Borrow Caps, Liquidation Threshold updates, freezing of assets, listing in isolation mode, etc.) Capital efficiency reductions on V2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to V3, where users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced risk mitigation mechanisms.

References: Website: [link] 2. documentation: [link] 1. Documents: Github: [link] 1. Source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed asset: fraxMinter 1.

Governance Discussion: [link] 1. Governance Voting: [link] Twitter: [link] 1. Summary: This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to add sfrxETH to the Ethereum V3 market as a reserve. Motivation: Frax Protocol is a decentralized synthetic asset platform that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. sfrxETH is a synthetic token that represents an exposure to the price of ETH. Adding sfrxETH to the Aave V3 market as a reserve would bring additional diversity and liquidity to the ecosystem. Frax Protocols synthetic assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets. Onboarding frxETH is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience. Aave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization. Specification: What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? The Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Frax Protocol to push this proposal. Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform. The ACI received support from the Frax Protocol team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer sfrxETH-related questions. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token? Frax Protocol is a decentralized synthetic asset platform that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. frxETH is a synthetic token that represents exposure to Ethereum Staking. The sfrxETH token can be used to gain exposure to the staking of ETH and its revenue without actually the need to run a validating node. This allows users to access Staking ETH without having to hold a 32 ETH minimum and run a node infrastructure. Adding sfrxETH to the Aave V3 market as a reserve would bring additional diversity and liquidity to the ecosystem. 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? sfrxETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Frax node operators. Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, sfrxETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value. sfrxETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens. sfrxETH is a good long-term holding collateral, but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans. sfrxETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave. sfrxETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase, and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? Core concepts to understand the unified Frax Finance ecosystem include: Fractional  Frax is the first and only stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmically stabilized. The stablecoin (FRAX) is named after this hybrid fractional-reserve system. Fraxswap, a native AMM  Fraxswap is the first AMM with time weighted average market maker orders used by the Frax Protocol for rebalancing collateral, mints/redemptions, expanding/contracting FRAX supply, and deploying protocol owned liquidity onchain. Fraxlend, permissionless lending markets  Fraxlend is the lending facility for the FRAX & FPI stablecoins allowing debt origination, customized non-custodial loans, and onboarding collateral assets to the Frax Finance economy. Crypto Native CPI Stablecoin  Fraxs end vision is to build the most important decentralized stablecoins in the world. The Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin is the first stablecoin pegged to a basket of consumer goods creating its own unit of account separate from any nation state denominated money. Four Tokens  FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Share (FXS) is the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem of smart contracts which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value. FPI is the inflation resistant, CPI pegged stablecoin. FPIS is the governance token of the Frax Price Index and splits its value capture with FXS holders. Gauge Rewards System  The community can propose new gauge rewards for strategies that integrate FRAX stablecoins. FXS emissions are fixed, halve each year, and entirely flow to different gauges based on the votes of veFXS stakers. Frax Ether: it is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smoothen the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH. 5. How is the sfrxETH token currently used? FraxLend is the current primary use case of sfrxETH to be used as collateral, with a liquidity of $13.6M. Its likely an Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of sfrxETH holding. sFrxETH is a yield-bearing Asset. 6. Emission schedule. There is no emission schedule. sfrxETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH to convert it to frxETH and then stake into frax protocol to obtain sfrxETH. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? sfrxETH is minted when stakers deposit frxETH into the Frax Protocol deposit pool, and sfrxETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their frxETH. The Frax protocol contracts do have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities. This was pointed out in code4Arena audit 1. 8.

Number of holders for token: 858 holders (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address) Technical Specifications. sfrxETH. sfrxETH is a ERC-4626 vault designed to accrue the staking yield of the Frax ETH validators. At any time, frxETH can be exchanged for sfrxETH by depositing it into the sfrxETH vault, which allows users to earn staking yield on their frxETH. Over time, as validators accrue staking yield, an equivalent amount of frxETH is minted and added to the vault, allowing users to redeem their sfrxETH for a greater amount of frxETH than they deposited. The exhange rate of frxETH per sfrxETH increases over time as staking rewards are added to the vault. By holding sfrxETH you hold a % claim on an increasing amount of the vaults frxETH, splitting staking rewards up among sfrxETH holders proportional to their share of the total sfrxETH. This is similar to other auto-compounding tokens like Aaves aUSDC. Security Considerations. Frax Finance smart contracts have been independently audited by : Code4Arena. bug bounty: The bounty is simply calculated as the lower value of 10% of the total possible exploit or $10m worth paid in FRAX+FXS (evenly split) [link] 1. Risk parameters. While we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams Gauntlet & @ChaosLabs, the ACI suggests the following risk parameters to start the conversation. These parameters define a non-borrowable asset with a 67% LTV. because sfrxETH has limited supply and liquidity compared to stETH and rETH, and because, as of now, minting permissions are not strictly limited, a supply cap is added in this proposal to limit protocol exposure to this asset. additionally, the current maturity of sfrxETH is not considered fit by the ACI to be a candidate for emode. The ACI invites the community to follow the evolution of sfrxETH and consider adjusting mid-term the risk parameters of sfrxETH. This will make sfrxETH slightly less attractive than stETH, rETH & cbETH but reflect the difference in liquidity between them. Symbol: sfrxETH. Isolation Mode: NO. Borrowable: NO.

If so, how much? What wallet will hold these LP tokens? Will that liquidity remain after the curve DAI is distributed? Should the DAO stake those LP tokens for GLTR? Should the DAO keep GHST-USDC as the primary liquidity pool? If supporting any secondary pools, where do we diversify out? What is our goal amount of decentralized liquidity? How does this compare to current liquidity? How fast should we seek to establish our goal amount? What are potential estimations for impermanent loss with different potential trajectories for GHST?

This vote is part of a set of different votes and AIPs around the deployment of [an Angle Gold stablecoin]([link]) The votes are the following: - AIP - 47: Launch agGOLD with ETH, USDC and wstETH as collateral assets. - AIP - 48: Seed an agGOLD - PAXG Curve pool using 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and $100k worth of agGOLD minted by governance. - AIP - 49: Launch a Curve direct deposit module on the agGOLD - PAXG pool that mints agGOLD whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. - AIP - 50: Seed an agGOLD - agEUR Uniswap V3 pool (0.3%) using 50k agEUR minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations and 50k worth of agGOLD minted from the protocols algorithmic market operations as well. - AIP - 51: Launch a gauge for the agGOLD-agEUR Uniswap V3 pool that can receive a part of the ANGLE inflation. - AIP - 52: Add support for agGOLD free flash-loans. Context. It was recently voted to launch an Angle stablecoin pegged to one unit of gold using the same borrowing module infrastructure as what there is for agEUR. Now that this deployment has been voted, its time to agree on the exact launch implementation details for agGOLD, with namely the parameters for the first collateral assets to be used. While launching agGOLD in itself could work and lead to some demand, it may be worth taking advantage of the protocols surplus and safety buffer to facilitate the deployment and launch of agGOLD. Over its existence, Angle has accumulated a surplus of $8m from transaction fees, interest and other direct deposit modules. This figure of $8m accounts for what can be seen in[the analytics]([link])and the[surplus investments]([link])made up by the governance since the protocols launch. On top of the Borrowing module, the infrastructure developed by the Angle protocol also comprises what is called Algorithmic market operations (AMOs) or direct deposit modules. The functioning of it is explained in[the docs]([link])but basically the protocol has the ability to mint agEUR to boostrap liquidity in some places. One of the main AMOs of the protocol consists in automatically adding agEUR liquidity on Curve in the agEUR-EUROC pool whenever there are more agEUR than EUROC. The protocol also engaged in AMOs to mint agEUR with pools with USDC on other chains, thus taking a slight risk of impermanent loss (covered by the protocols surplus) AMOs have recently been used to bootstrap agEUR liquidity in some places, but one other tool the protocol has to grow liquidity is ANGLE incentives. ANGLE inflation is directed by[gauge votes]([link])ran by veANGLE holders. The system leaves the possibility to whitelist new pools to receive incentives.[A new system]([link])was recently added to leave the protocol a full flexibility when it comes to incentivizing UniV3 pools. Proposals, Implementations & Risks. The proposals here are a set of proposals to be voted independently of one another on the governance forum. AIP - 47. The purpose of this proposal is to specify with which collateral assets and parameters the Angle Gold stablecoin will be deployed. Idea here is to start with wETH, wstETH and USDC as collateral assets for the borrowing of agGOLD. This should open the use cases of people shorting XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. Adding wstETH on top of ETH for the use case of shorting the ETH variations of gold is a way to make the protocol more attractive as users would be able to earn a yield while also borrowing their gold stablecoin. Parameters suggested can be found in[this PR]([link])of the Angle SDK. The same AgToken implementation as agEUR, the same treasury contract and the same deployment scripts.[This PR]([link])gives an idea of how agGOLD will be deployed on Ethereum. Risks. The main risks associated to this proposal are the following: - centralization risk due to adding support for USDC and in some way to wstETH (handled by Lido) - risk of bad debt due to liquidators not coming in. To look into the parameters suggested in the SDK PR you can check[this simulation file]([link])and see in which conditions the protocol would be at loss for a liquidation. Parameters are set given predicted agGOLD liquidity and they're overall far more conservative than for agEUR. AIP - 48. This proposal consists in pulling 100k USDC from the protocol surplus and swap these USDC into PAXG. This can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or OTC with market makers having access to deeper PAXG-USDC liquidity than whats on-chain) Following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the Angle governance address on the agGOLD stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of agGOLD stablecoins as PAXG obtained. Liquidity will then be added on a Curve agGOLD-PAXG pool to be created upon agGOLD deployment (need contract address) Risks. This proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. Indeed the USDC used to buy PAXG from the protocol surplus come from the agEUR surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the PAXG bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect agEURs peg. In addition, minting agGOLD in a pool with PAXG is equivalent in backing the minted agGOLD with PAXG. And so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on PAXG for the protocol. If PAXG was to depeg, then agGOLD would most likely depeg as well. AIP - 49. While the proposal above aims at setting a manual form of AMO for PAXG, AIP-49 consists in going further and launching for agGOLD an automated AMO that mints agGOLD in the Curve pool with PAXG whenever there are more PAXG than agGOLD in the pool. This would use the exact same contract infrastructure (designed to support multiple stablecoins) as what is done for the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve. More details on this setup can be found[here]([link]) Once there is a gauge in the Curve pool, LP tokens obtained from this AMO could be staked on Convex and StakeDAO to increase the revenue made by the protocol. Smart contracts for the AMOs of the protocol can be found[here]([link]) Risks. The major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to PAXG for agGOLD. It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now) AIP - 50. A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. This would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol. Risks. This is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. It indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation. If the price of GOLD was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. As such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal. Intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of XAU/EUR price variations. If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins. The estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow agEUR-agGOLD liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that it'd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period. Note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain agEUR and agGOLD. At the exception of this AMO, agEUR and agGOLD will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. This AMO is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use agEUR surplus to compensate for a potential agGOLD bad debt coming from this AMO (or conversely) Apart from this, we propose to keep agEUR and agGOLD as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. If scaled, the size of this AMO should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time. AIP - 51. Even though it is proposed to seed the agEUR-agGOLD pool, it is still important to have a way to provide incentives to agGOLD holders. This proposal is to make the UniV3 agEUR-agGOLD pool a gauge for which veANGLE holders can vote to distribute a portion of the ANGLE inflation. Idea would be to use[Angle incentivization system for Uniswap V3]([link])liquidity that maximizes the efficiency given to liquidity providers (no need to stake) while guaranteeing that both TVL (agEUR and agGOLD liquidity) and concentrated liquidity are incentivized. Like all other gauges on Ethereum mainnet, we propose to give a boost of up to 2.5x to all addresses owning veANGLE tokens and participating in the gauge. Proposed parameters for the incentivization formula are the following: 34% to agGOLD holders, 33% to agEUR holders, and 33% for the fees accumulated on the pool. Risks. The risks in setting up a gauge are the risks of a vampire attack where a big veANGLE holder drives a lot (if not all) of incentives to the pool (even though its not beneficial to the protocol in the long run) Governance could kill the gauge in this case. The other risk is to decrease in other places the incentives given to protocol stakeholders. If too much is sent to agEUR-agGOLD LP, then agEUR-USDC liquidity could be decreasing as a result of the lesser incentives being sent. AIP - 52. The protocol has a flash loan module that is ready for its stablecoins. The goal of this last proposal is to enable free agGOLD flash-loans. With the limited initial liquidity, and to avoid the risk of potential exploits on protocols using agGOLD, we propose to limit the size of the possible flash-loans to 10% of the agGOLD circulating supply. The'FlashAngle'contract that handles flash loans has been audited and it is already in use for agEUR. It only implies a governance transaction (and no new smart contract deployments) to enable this module. Risks. Flash-loans have historically been used in some hacks. Enabling agGOLD flash-loans might expose protocols which are not resistant to flash-loan attacks and which are using agGOLD to some manipulation risk. Value to the protocol. All together these AIP are here to guarantee that agGOLD will be deployed and usable at a minimal cost (time, incentives and money) for the protocol and the DAO. With the liquidity pools setup through AMOs, it is expected that agGOLD will be from scratch in arbitrage routes involving PAXG and in trade routes used by people buying and selling PAXG. It will facilitate the movement of people swapping PAXG to agGOLD because there will be no fee on transfer for PAXG, just like it will facilitate trades for people who are looking to hold a gold derivative on-chain. Thanks to the collateral assets suggested as well for agGOLD, there should be some direct use cases of using the borrowing module: people would be able to short XAU/USD and XAU/ETH. The development cost of all these AIPs as it just implies relying on the infrastructure already developed around agEUR. While agGOLD is a nice add-on for DeFi, it will also be a way to showcase the whole protocol knowledge and expertise when it comes to stablecoin design and operations. Voting Options. 1.

Mark11 (Fraximalist) Summary. This proposal (part of three separate proposals) seeks to add [2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC)]([link]) on Balancer to FXS gauge controller. Background & Motivation. Frax has become the master of the Curve wars and Balancer is another frontier. There is a lot of utility and liquidity over at Balancer making use of its unique product offerings. For example things like 20%/80% pools which many protocols prefer for governance token liquidity, and LBP for token launches coordinated through PrimeDAO and Fjord Foundry. Also protocols like Olympus are stationing their main liquidity pools over on Balancer. Balancer also has the ability for protocols to have deployed liquidity in [boosted pools]([link]) such as the pool referred to in this proposal. These pools have the following advantages: High Capital Efficiency Boosted Pools are designed to deliver high capital efficiency by enabling users to provide trade liquidity for common tokens while forwarding idle tokens to external protocols. This gives liquidity providers the benefits of Euler on top of the swap fees they collect from trades. Superfluid, Consolidated Liquidity Nesting pool tokens creates a powerful avenue to make swaps between any stablecoin and underlying borrowing protocol tokens in the Boosted Pool. On top of that, any token in a pool with a Boosted Pool Token can tap directly into the underlying tokens. !([link]]) Example of an already deployed USD pool. We need FRAX to be everywhere and Balancer is likely to be a part of the overall mix when it comes to medium-term liquidity destinations. Relevantly, Aura proposes to be the Convex of the Balancer ecosystem and AURA holders direct the veBAL locked as auraBAL. It can be more economical to bribe AURA holders than veBAL holders directly to direct BAL rewards to a preferred pool. Presently there is a [profitable opportunities]([link]) for bribing veBAL or veAura holders. The 2pool The 2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC) would be initially funded by an AMO deposit of liquidity and allow trades between FRAX and USDC in a capital efficient manner - while earning lending interest from Euler. It would also allow nesting of other tokens with the 2pool for example frxETH-2pool, FXS-2pool, FPI-2pool, etc, and allow direct trading between USDC or FRAX and the nested token (for example ETH->FRAX, ETH->USDC) This can also serve as a rail between Curve liquidity and Balancer liquidity.

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-01-31. Simple Summary. This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to add Aave Ethereum V3 support for the safety Module. Abstract. The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilized to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds. This AIP proposes to extend the coverage of the Safety module to Aave V3 Ethereum Contracts. Motivation. Aave V3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks. Aave V3 has been battle tested for ~10 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance. The ACI is supportive of extending coverage of Aave V3 by the safety module in order to offer the V3 Ethereum users the same level of coverage as V2 users. While the current version of the safety module has room for improvement and would benefit from a re-engineering and improved implementation, its the currently available tool, and the deployment of V3 makes it a suitable candidate to cover Aave V3 users on Ethereum. Specification. It is important to note that in the current implementation of the Safety module, a potential shortfall event needs to be implemented individually by an ad hoc AIP. This proposal is then more a community guideline that sets precedence on Aave decision to support V3 in case of a shortfall event impacting the V3 market. For this reason, this ARC, if consensus is found, can escalate to a snapshot vote but does not require a payload execution triggered by an AIP vote. a Snapshot outcome thus would be considered canon without requiring an AIP on-chain vote with an empty payload.

A proposal to increase the supply cap for sAVAX on Avalanche V3. Motivation. In this proposal, Chaos Labs recommends increasing the supply cap for sAVAX on Avalanche V3, which has reached 100% utilization. sAVAX Oracle. The sAVAX oracle on Aave is unique in implementation. The custom-built oracle adapter attaches itself' to two contracts to calculate the price for sAVAX. Half of the price is derived from the AVAX-USD Chainlink feed. Half of the price is derived from the sAVAX contract. Unlike rebasing tokens (i.e., Aaves aTokens), sAVAX accumulates the underlying yield of staking AVAX and distributes the yield to sAVAX holders via the exchange rate. This composition of the sAVAX oracle means that its price will always be equal to or higher than that of AVAX. E-Mode Liquidations. The majority (83%) of sAVAX is lent within E-mode. ![sAVAX (1)jpg]([link]) Given that the oracle will only show increasing prices compared to AVAX, it is unlikely for a lender to get liquidated in the leveraged loop on the correlated E-mode. There is a theoretical possibility of liquidation due to interest rate payments on the loan. However, we do not think this poses a significant risk on account of the following: - If Aave borrowing APY < sAVAX Staking APY, then the price appreciation is greater than IR payments, and no liquidation will take place. - If Aave borrowing APY > sAVAX Staking APY, then it will be unprofitable for sAVAX holders to borrow AVAX against sAVAX, as they'd rather simply unstake their AVAX. Non E-Mode Liquidations. Outside of E-mode, with the liquidation bonus set at 10%, liquidators may choose to seize sAVAX if an accounts health dips below one and sell off the sAVAX with a higher profit margin than other collateral. In the past 90 days, we have seen 19 liquidations of a total amount of ~$2,000. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 6.25.44 [image]]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-14 at 2.56.18 [image]]([link]) The majority of liquidity for sAVAX is on Platypus Finance. A single swap of 145,000 sAVAX incurs slippage lower than the 10% liquidation penalty. On Trader Joe, there is additional liquidity of around 10% of the amount available on Platypus within the same price impact range. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-14 at 21.00.36 (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-14 at 21.01.53 (1)png]([link]) Conclusion. While in E-mode, given the characteristics of the sAVAX oracle, sAVAX-AVAX lenders/borrowers cannot face liquidation, pushing the risks primarily towards the sAVAX counter-party risk, i.e., sAVAX contract breaking or failing (audits of Benqi smart contracts - link 1, link 2, link 3) Therefore, we mainly observe considerations of liquidity that will serve the liquidations of positions outside of E-mode. Less than 20% of sAVAX is currently out of eMode, which is approximately the amount that can be liquidated profitably at once on Platypus and Trader Joes. While liquidity is not constant, we see across several observations that the liquidity available for sAVAX is maintained around these levels. Under the current risk parameters of 30% LT outside of E-mode, we assume that sAVAX collateral increase will distribute similarly and may lean even more towards E-mode positions than the current supply. Under this assumption, even when we increase the supply cap by 100%, there is still enough liquidity to profitably liquidate 50% of the total positions that may be liquidated (outside of E-mode) With these defensive assumptions, we recommend increasing the supply cap to 2M sAVAX. Recommendations. Asset. | Current Supply |Current Supply Cap |Recommended Supply Cap. --- |---|---|---| sAVAX |999,910 |1,000,000 |2,000,000. --- Disclaimer: Benqi is an existing customer of Chaos Labs' risk and optimization services which provides us further visibility and knowledge of risks related to sAVAX. That engagement is unrelated to work done for Aave, and they do not compensate us for asset listing or parameter modifications on any instance of Aave, but we have shared this proposal with them for initial feedback as we do with most projects interacting with the Aave protocol to ensure its accuracy.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHEVZ1U1pHfRmfje6X4uHxVR2IA", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954172, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chaos Labs is proposing to increase the supply cap for sAVAX on Avalanche V3 because it has reached its maximum usage.

Proposal TL;DR: Aave has been trailblazing DeFi since inception and continues to embrace new frontiers and innovation to this day. The protocol has become a dominant player in DeFi lending across networks - be it alt L1s or L2s. Scroll wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and propose to the Aave community to authorize the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet. Zk rollups are widely considered to be the holy grail of Ethereum scaling. Recent breakthroughs have allowed the space to mature much faster than originally anticipated 1, which has positioned Scroll to build the next generation of scaling solutions that has achieved: - bytecode compatibility with the EVM: No new languages, tooling, trust in custom architecture or re-audits needed. Aave will be able to port over its codebase instantly and seamlessly without any extra engineering resources required. - top-tier security through process and architecture: Scroll has been open-sourced from day one and has been designed to prioritize the decentralization of its prover and sequencer networks, making it unique in the zk rollup space. - pushing boundaries of cutting edge research: Establishing a presence on Scroll will allow Aave to capture the zkEVM market in advance and reap L2 native innovation from the start and even contribute to steering how L2 user behavior will evolve short and long-term. Generally, we believe that Aaves community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit or location. In the following we detail Scrolls architecture and mission and how it will benefit the Aave community. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the communitys questions. About Scroll Scroll 1 is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent zk rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security. EVM equivalence & Developer Friendliness: Anything less than bytecode level compatibility is an unnecessary risk that protocols should not settle for. We don't think developers should have to learn a new language or trust custom architecture which introduces unknown risk. Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure and will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously. - Community first: Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community for the community! That also means that Scroll has been peer reviewed and open source from day one. We intend to follow this strategy going forward. We will foster community innovation and participate in the incubation of new open source tools and features for the L2 space. We intend to be the 1 platform for developers and we are working with the best to achieve this (Ethereum Foundation (PSE), 0xparc, zcash, Filecoin, and many more) - Decentralization & Security: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is committed to outsource proof generation. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem. In addition to that Scroll has a strong in-house security team that found and reported bugs in fellow zk RUs proving systems in the past. - Education & Research: We pride ourselves in making research accessible to all. We continuously publish research in an effort to demystify the inner works of zk circuits (see [link] and our public zk reading group) Scroll has been able to establish a recognized and sought after brand within a short amount of time which is also due to event series like Rollup Day which was appreciated across the board of L2 industry leaders. - Advance Ethereums ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereums ultimate goal of \"zkSNARK Everything . Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum! We are live on testnet and our ecosystem is rapidly growing. Since the beginning of January 2023 our testnet has seen over 900k unique wallet addresses, and this month we've averaged over 500k transactions a day  all helping to test the robustness of our network. We have been working with major infrastructure players (including the Graph, Safe, Covalent, Orbiter, and many more) to add support for critical building blocks on the network, and we're working with best-in-class Ethereum dApps to join the network too (including Uniswap v3 on Scroll testnet) Aave on Scroll By launching on testnet, Aave has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with lending protocols such as Aave. Aave is a uniquely important DeFi lender in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that a zk L2 affords. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now (e.g. going beyond flashloans with atomic (cross zk-RU) txs in a post-Danksharding Ethereum and further use cases we'd love to co-develop) Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available. We are excited to help foster an ecosystem fuelled by creativity that revolves around Aave and the distribution of $GHO. Bridge Security Zk rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics. Currently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges. Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase. Timeline The Scroll team will first submit the necessary snapshots for deploying Aave v3 on our testnet, following the community guidelines and working with BDG Labs on what is required. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks and we commit to dedicating engineering resources to support the Aave integrations team. It is important to us to be closely in touch with the Aave community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.

Discourse Thread: [link] We, The Aavegotchi Forge Team, propose a 6 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing features on the Aavegotchi protocol. We have worked diligently since October to deliver the Forge with intensive ideation, economics development, art creation, DAO navigation, smart contract execution, and user interface work. We have set the stage to continue to build features that will add value to native assets and increase engagement. Over this six month period, we plan to launch at least 4 new features while maintaining and improving the initial Forge launch, economics, and user experience. A contracted six-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 will likely generate enough GHST revenue to have paid for itself, but, more importantly, creates a path towards sustainable revenue without dilution through schematics. It also creates opportunities to create new content that accrues value into our native assets. Forge Team Roadmap: [link] - Evolving pets/Upgradeable wearables  obtain upgraded schematics by engagement and through \"feeding tokens or assets to the pet. - Custom backgrounds  Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds. - New BRS-modifying slot  Create a new slot, ensure value accrual to native assets, maximize engagement, and provide new metas for future rarity farming iterations. - Schematic sales  Plan for quarterly release of new schematics and maintenance of the Core Framework document. There are no current plans for additional core releases prior to review. - Other potential ideas that can be pursued: non-brs modifying wearables, \"skins for existing wearables, gems obtained by smelting or from land parcels with boosts. Forge Team Stipend: For this work, diddly will be hired on as a full time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 7 month total stipend vs 6 months for the rest of the team.

This a follow-up proposal to the \"[Temperature Check - How should HOP compensate Multi-Sig Signers]([link]) proposal, which has already been passed off-chain and on-chain by the community. Abstract. This proposal outlines the process for nomination, election, and compensation of multisig signers for the Hop DAO Community Multisig. The proposal aims to define the multisigs goals and clarify the process for joining and participating in the Hop DAO multisig. Nomination and Election. Every six months, there will be a nomination process and subsequent election to replace the five Hop DAO Community Multisig signers. Stats should be kept about the incumbent signers number and speed of signatures in the 6-month period and displayed during elections. A forum post should be started where applicants indicate their interest in the role through a formal application stating: Who they are Outlining their track record of reliability in previous roles How they contribute to the Hop Ecosystem. The nomination process should run for seven days with question and answer, after which a subsequent snapshot election will be held; after the election, the top 5 applicants will become the new Hop Multi-Sig Signers. Responsibilities. The Community Multisig exists for the Hop DAO to transact faster and with more flexibility than can the full governance timelock. However, the multisigs purpose should be to reduce its role in the DAO as much as possible. Each signer will be responsible for verifying transactions, checking merkle roots, and signing off on transactions as necessary. The signers will work together to manage the nomination and election process, with each signer taking on specific tasks to ensure that the process runs smoothly. The signers will also work together to manage the day-to-day operations of the multisig, including responding to questions from the community and ensuring that transactions are executed in a timely and efficient manner. Compensation: Salary: As an amendment to [HIP-12]([link]), Multi-Sig Signer compensation will be $2,250 twice a year for = $4,500 4 = $18,000. Bringing the total cost to = $18,000. Gas Rebates: As ETH is spent to execute multisig transactions, we propose that each signer is reimbursed for the exact amount of gas spent during the 6-month term. To be eligible for a rebate, we propose that signers use a Google Sheet template to track gas costs. A dune dashboard or other data query can replace this. We further propose that gas rebates (but not full compensation), where reasonable, are extended to all Hop related multisigs (e.g. Grants Program multisig)\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHEIndyy2pEncXnBnVRCu8Xb5AI", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954172, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal is about how the Hop DAO Community Multisig should operate.

The proposal is to use 150k USDC from the protocols surplus, to be converted to USDT and bridged to BNB Chain, mint a corresponding amount of agEUR on BNB Chain, and then seed a agEUR/USDT pool on PancakeSwap. The exact amount of agEUR to mint will depend on the initial EUR/USD price at the time of the implementation. Note that if you want to play with impermanent loss simulation, we have built a simulator on the Angle App at Angle Protocol. Implementation. The minted agEUR would be from AMOs. As previously discussed in similar instances, the rationale for minting agEUR that way is that the protocol could technically fetch the required amount from its surplus but there will be an opportunity cost for doing so since the USDC fetched from the surplus would no longer be invested in the yield strategies of the protocols. With $150k worth of agEUR from AMOs, these agEUR are still backed by the USDC that are used to issue them and if the value of the USD came to decrease (meaning that a portion of the agEUR issued through AMO would be \"unbacked), then the protocol could still rely on its surplus to hedge for the \"loss. As such, using AMOs is a way to mitigate the opportunity cost while still relying in some way on the surplus the protocol has accumulated. In addition, this amount is a conservative amount to bootstrap liquidity. As this goes live, its going to be important for the protocol to increase or decrease the size of the positions depending on volume. Value to the protocol. Deploying a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap is intended to unleash a wide range of opportunities for agEUR in the BNB ecosystem allowing it to be more easily integrated with the protocols that are getting built there. Bootstrapping agEUR liquidity on BNB Chain through PancakeSwap is also an efficient choice for the protocol as PancakeSwap is the most popular and most used DEX on BNB with roughly $50m to $100m+ daily volume. Risks. This proposal bears a risk of bad debt also possible with the agEUR paired with USDT in the AMOs, but given the size of the pool proposed and the surplus currently incurred by the protocol, this can reasonably be considered as acceptable.

' Simple Summary. Fee discounts for COW token holders were introduced in [CIP-3]([link]), March 2022. The allocated budget for discount is now about to get [depleted]([link]) (59.4 ETH used out of 60 ETH budget) This proposal is aimed to reflect on the usage of discounts so far, discuss potential changes, and propose a new budget for discounts. Motivation. Trading fee discounts are a very popular incentive mechanism used across the crypto industry by top CEXs and DEXs. At this point in time, it is one of the important use cases for the COW token, allowing users to realize some benefits already today. Usage stats Below is a table sourced from [this dune query]([link]), showing the number of traders and the total dollar amount spent per discount tier. | discount_tier | num_traders | total_subsidy | | --- | --- | --- | | 0.05 | 1374 | 11217.62 | | 0.1 | 1305 | 74280.23 | | 0.2 | 226 | 19012.47 | | 0.4 | 17 | 7143.20 | Another [query]([link]) helps us to determine the percentage of CoW Swap trades that enjoy a discount due to holding COW: 21% (53k out of 249k) Looking at the [net spending]([link]) on fee discounts per month, we see a clear decline from April, when the discount was introduced and until July 2022. Since July spending on discounts is ranging $1k-$5k per month. Those metrics indicate that the fee discount is relatively widely used by many of CoW Swap users where the majority of the budget spent on lower fee discount tiers. Specification. The fee discount is implemented by producing a lower fee quote to orders of users that hold COW tokens. Fees are collected in the sell token and are converted to ETH at the end of every week in order to cover the execution gas cost. Implementing a fee discount just means the protocol will not fully cover the gas execution cost with the collected fees from orders submitted by COW holders. The proposed budget will be used to cover the mismatch between collected fees and gas execution cost payed out to solvers. No additional technical implementation is required. It is proposed to allocate 50k DAI as a budget for discounts to COW token holders. If the same burn rate is maintained in the future, the new budget is estimated to last 10 months or more. Rationale. It is proposed that the required 50k DAI will be withdrawn from the treasury management safe, and converted to ETH using a milkman order with Uniswap v3 price checker using DAI-WETH 0.05% fee pool, where the destination safe is the [solver rewards safe]([link]) Safe Transaction Data.

Mark11 (Fraximalist) Summary. This proposal (part of three separate proposals) seeks to approve a budget of $100k worth of FXS or cvxCRV in bribes for a pilot bribe program (3 months) to veBAL or AURA holders (only where profitable to do so) to boost liquidity to the [2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC)]([link]) or other pools pairing with 2pool. Background & Motivation. Frax has become the master of the Curve wars and Balancer is another frontier. There is a lot of utility and liquidity over at Balancer making use of its unique product offerings. For example things like 20%/80% pools which many protocols prefer for governance token liquidity, and LBP for token launches coordinated through PrimeDAO and Fjord Foundry. Also protocols like Olympus are stationing their main liquidity pools over on Balancer. Balancer also has the ability for protocols to have deployed liquidity in [boosted pools]([link]) such as the pool referred to in this proposal. These pools have the following advantages: High Capital Efficiency Boosted Pools are designed to deliver high capital efficiency by enabling users to provide trade liquidity for common tokens while forwarding idle tokens to external protocols. This gives liquidity providers the benefits of Euler on top of the swap fees they collect from trades. Superfluid, Consolidated Liquidity Nesting pool tokens creates a powerful avenue to make swaps between any stablecoin and underlying borrowing protocol tokens in the Boosted Pool. On top of that, any token in a pool with a Boosted Pool Token can tap directly into the underlying tokens. !([link]]) Example of an already deployed USD pool. We need FRAX to be everywhere and Balancer is likely to be a part of the overall mix when it comes to medium-term liquidity destinations. Relevantly, Aura proposes to be the Convex of the Balancer ecosystem and AURA holders direct the veBAL locked as auraBAL. It can be more economical to bribe AURA holders than veBAL holders directly to direct BAL rewards to a preferred pool. Presently there is a [profitable opportunities]([link]) for bribing veBAL or veAura holders. The 2pool The 2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC) would be initially funded by an AMO deposit of liquidity and allow trades between FRAX and USDC in a capital efficient manner - while earning lending interest from Euler. It would also allow nesting of other tokens with the 2pool for example frxETH-2pool, FXS-2pool, FPI-2pool, etc, and allow direct trading between USDC or FRAX and the nested token (for example ETH->FRAX, ETH->USDC) This can also serve as a rail between Curve liquidity and Balancer liquidity. The 2pool has been deployed by Balancer core team at [Balancer]([link]) A veBAL gauge is being voted on here and is well supported by Balancer governance here [Snapshot]([link]) Security & Risk.

GotchiID: 24877. Discourse links: [link] INTRODUCTION. Hello Frens ! The proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25/25/25/25% split is likely to pass. One of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery. At the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the risks impermanent loss when the curve will close. We have a liquidity target of around $5 million, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage. LIQUIDITY PROVISION. Together with the curve transition team, we would like to secure enough funds that will serve directly as liquidity to DEXs. We are thinking of two DEXs: Quickswap and Balancer, we are in discussions to secure rewards from these projects. We have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmys 110k) To add the liquidity, we thought of 3 types of pool, either Balancer pools with pools of type 80(GHST)-20(Stable) or 75(GHST)-25(Stable), or usual pool type 50-50. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, the Balancer pool looks quite interesting because it would allow the DAO to provide more than $2M worth of liquidity pre-closure. If we were to use 950k DAI in a weighted balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.30: 75-25 pool: 2,192,000 (3,800,000$ pool total) 80-20 pool: 2,923,000 (4,750,000$ pool total) 50-50 pool: 736,000 (1,900,000$ pool total) LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM. To achieve the $5M liquidity target, we believe that a possible option could be a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO. Here is a chart of LM reward costs. The X-axis is clusters of different target APRs for different amounts of goal external liquidity provision. The Y-axis is the LM reward expense. ![[image]]([link]) This is the calculation of potential DAO Impermanent Loss. The highlighted column assumes the DAO provided $2M in liquidity and highlights the IL at different GHST values. ![[image]]([link]) We are targeting $3 million in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require $250,000 in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $3.75 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program is expected to begin shortly before the curve closes. These numbers are only indicative, maybe we can go up to $500,000 in LM rewards at the beginning to give the project an impulse and have a nice price discovery ? SUMMARY. So to summarise, we would like to secure $4M ($3M5 for the liquidity provision depending on the type of pool used and about $500k for the LM program) These numbers are obviously subject to adjustments but these $4M would be a maximum used for the liquidity provision at least for a pre-curve program. As an indication, there is 27M of DAI in the contract of curve, which gives $7M of DAI which must be used for increasing liquidity. We're asking for your feedback and we will be happy to discuss the numbers presented by the CTT.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHE26n46IAOiBz9EOiQdpWBhWEV", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954172, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello everyone!

Expenditure on solver rewards in this period were very closely according to estimations in CIP-10, COW tokens allocated for this purpose are going to be depleted roughly at the end of February. This CIP is intended to propose a new budget for solver rewards. Motivation. There are 12 independently running solvers at the time of writing, consistently competing to provide batch solutions and consequently ensuring best-execution for CoW Swap users. It is safe to assume that a major motive for running a solver is winning solver rewards. This proposal aims to ensure appropriate funding to continue rewarding solvers and hence supporting a competitive solver landscape. It is important to note that this budgeting proposal is independent of additional proposals to potentially change the solver reward structure ([CIP-Draft: Auction model for solver rewards]([link])), which can be configured for appropriate spending according to the budget. Specification. Transfer 10M COW from CoW DAO ('[hexadecimals]') to the Solver Rewards safe ('[hexadecimals]') Rationale. Solver rewards are planned to continue using the same operational structure, carried out from the solver rewards safe. ETH for compensating gas execution costs is estimated to be fully covered by collecting fees from users. It is proposed to allocate 10M COW tokens for a 6 month period of rewards.

Currently, Frax Finance offers users the option to lock their tokens for one year in exchange for a 2x boost. However, this option has not proven more effective than the previous option of locking tokens for three years for a 3x boost. Therefore, we propose to move the lock option back to three years for a 3x boost.

By moving the lock option back to three years, we hope to achieve the following goals: Encourage users to lock their tokens for a longer period, resulting in increased liquidity, trading volumes, protocol stability, and anti-reflexivity in the stablecoin peg. Provide users with a more attractive incentive to lock their tokens, improving the platforms overall performance.

A proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Ethereum assets. Motivation. Aave V3 Ethereum was launched successfully on January 27th, 2023, with a conservative configuration for the initial assets, as [recommended]([link]) by Chaos Labs. Following the successful launch and after analyzing the initial supply and borrow distribution and general usage across the deployment, we propose incrementally increasing the LTs and LTVs for USDC and DAI with the following goals: 1. Provide a sustainable set of parameters that are better optimized for risk-reward in the long term. 2. Serve as a catalyst to promote migration of funds from V2 to V3, as capital efficiency under the current parameter settings is significantly inferior to V2. Note: As a general guideline, we limit our proposed changes by 3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range. It is important to note that V3 Ethereum still needs to be integrated into our parameter recommendation platform, and therefore the recommendations provided here are not simulation-based. However, from running our simulations on similar assets on Arbitrum and Avalanche and considering the differences between the deployments, we conclude that the provided parameters are still conservative and can be further increased toward an optimized state in future iterations.

Pocket Network is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the RPC layer. Our goal is to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving, multi-chain gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers to mint reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported, including both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival. Over the last month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 2 spot in terms of requests per day at 195M daily avgerage requests according to POKTscan! Abstract. By sponsoring a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, GnosisDAO and Pocket Network would continue to contribute to the decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All the while, continuing to incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens for serving Gnosis dapps. Public RPCs are a public good, we hope to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users. The Pocket Network team and community have been a long-time supporters of the Gnosis Chain. We're proud to continue supporting Gnosis! Motivation. The current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) we suport are: Gnosis Chain = 0027 (mainnet) Gnosis Chain Archival = 000C (mainnet) The POKTdao allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07/06/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival (000C) shortly after on 08/26/21) Since the allowlist date, Pocket node operators earned 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read/write requests. See this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned: [link] Over that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated, stable, and higher-performant pools of nodes. Our network of node runners easily handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day recently in JAN 2023. According to POKTscan, there are currently 22,379 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,561 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain ID. This demonstrates the POKT node incentives at work! The POKTdao supported node deployment solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode to make it super easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full/archival nodes within the Pocket Network protocol. Rationale. Pocket Network Inc. staked POKT on behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsizie a public good in the form of public RPC endpoints (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits: [link] [link] We've simplified our model this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more affordable. To sweeten the deal, we are offering the Gnosis DAO team and community a massive discount on a 200M requests per day throughput on a 1-year commitment with the option to renew on an annual basis: $135,997 USD for 200M Requests Per Day on a 1-year Contract (i.e. next 12 months) That represents 4.8x in savings (a 480% discount) compared to the original offer! In case a buffer is wanted/needed, as traffic continues to grow, we'd like to extend another option to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price of $0.0000018640 per request throughout the contract period.

Gauntlets risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify liquidation bonus on one (1) Aave V3 AVAX asset without adding outsized market risk. Additionally, we provide user position analysis below. Abstract. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework]([link]) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. Motivation. This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior) Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard]([link]) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

Motivation. --- An active governance culture is an essential aspect of every DAOs operations. Active governance means that the community is dedicated to improving the protocols operations, which builds a culture of iteration around the protocol. However, governance work is continuously under or unpaid, making it an unattractive role. By incentivizing an active governance culture at 1inch, we can attract participants to become more involved in 1inch DAO, thus enabling more opportunities for 1INCH to decentralize. 1INCH DAO tried a similar program last year using[Layer 3]([link]), which was successful in attracting participants.

We hope some form of incentive will attract users to engage with the 1inch DAO. We would like to present this program for 6 months at a total cost of 6,000 USDC. Allocation. This proposal would allocate 6,000 USDC to a newly-made community multi-sig. Each successful proposal would receive 500 USDC. At the end of each month, the community multi-sig will distribute rewards to the eligible authors. This is to reduce the unnecessary cost to the DAO. This would incentivize a total of 12 proposals across 6 months. Since 1INCH earns protocol revenue in USDC, it is easier to distribute governance rewards in USDC. If all USDC is distributed, this would cost the DAO 6,000 USDC for 6 months. Eligibility. Eligible Proposals. All proposals that follow the outlined [governance workflow]([link]) within 1inch DAO and successfully pass Phase 4. Ineligible Proposals. 1. Proposals requesting budgets or grants are excluded. 1. Grants are directed to the current [1inch grant program]([link]) 3. Proposals making minimal amendments to previous proposals (e.g. fixing only typos) are excluded from this program. 4.

Hameed. Proposal Summary. Set the target collateral ratio (CR) of the Frax protocol to 100% The increase in the CR will be achieved over time through protocol growth and earnings. This proposal does not include minting any FXS to increase the CR. Abstract. The time has come for Frax to gradually remove the algorithmic backing of the protocol. The Frax protocol has grown and evolved dramatically since the protocol launched in December 2020. The original protocol included a variable collateral ratio which adjusted based on the market demand of FRAX, effectively letting the market dictate how much collateral was necessary for each FRAX to equal $1.00. This was a highly innovative, elegant approach that Frax pioneered but has now outgrown. The costs of being slightly undercollateralized now far outweigh the benefits  especially because it can undermine the perceived safety of FRAX. Gradually shifting the protocol to 100% CR is the best path forward for the long-term health and growth of the protocol. This is a significant change to the protocol that over time effectively retires the algorithmic backing of Frax. It has become clear to many active in the community that this is the best path forward. The intention of this proposal is to coordinate the community on increasing the CR to 100% permanently. It is more focused on the destination (100% CR) than how we get there - there is no imminent need to increase the CR and there are many ways of reaching the target CR. Ideally growth, asset appreciation and protocol earnings will increase the CR to 100% over time. To be clear, this proposal does not rely on minting any FXS to achieve the 100% CR. Background and Motivation. Frax has always approached the algorithmic backing of FRAX conservatively. Even before launch, it was clear that relying on FXS to back the algorithmic portion of FRAX required locked liquidity to ensure smooth functioning of the protocol. Unfortunately, we have now seen many projects that didn't understand this and failed. The downside of locked liquidity is that the protocol pays for it in the form of FXS rewards. While this approach made sense to start, the circumstances around Frax have changed. Frax achieved 0 to 1 product market fit and now has a supply exceeding 1,000,000,000 FRAX. The next phase of growth requires increasing the \"money attributes of FRAX, specifically making FRAX an asset that users are comfortable holding, without any incentive, as a long-term store of value. The small algorithmic backing of FRAX creates the perception that FRAX is the less safe option for users to hold, especially after USTs failure tainted the algorithmic stablecoin concept (whether fairly or unfairly) There is very little benefit in maintaining the current CR of 92% @dennett has made the point that FRAX can be fully collateralized by non-FXS assets and still be fractional reserve by deploying protocol owned liquidity via AMOs. Increasing protocol collateral also means that additional collateral can be deployed via AMOs to create liquidity and revenue for the protocol. Frax will continue to be the most capital efficient safe stablecoin while removing the need to constantly fund locked liquidity. At this point, all protocol expansions occur via AMO and effectively are at 100% CR. This means that protocol growth increases the CR. The gentlest way to increase the CR is to retain protocol earnings as the protocol grows. As part of this proposal, FXS buybacks will be deferred until the CR reaches 100% This is effectively an investment in the future of Frax that will increase protocol assets and remove the need for FXS emissions towards locked liquidity. There appears to be little impact from FXS buybacks lately and the impact is probably overestimated at this point. This proposal does not impact the current veFXS yield. From the perspective of FXS holders, this proposal should increase the soundness / perception of Frax and accelerate protocol growth. Finally, this proposal would authorize protocol comptrollers to strategically exchange up to $3m of protocol assets for frxETH each month. frxETH is becoming an important decentralized asset on Fraxs balance sheet, both increasing the CR while also increasing the supply of frxETH and validators. frxETH also offers a strong return potential for the protocol. Up to $3m per month is a small amount given the size of Fraxs protocol assets  it also limits the protocols exposure to frxETH price volatility by keeping the value relatively small. The selling of protocol assets authorized by this proposal is not intended to decrease Fraxs holdings of CVX or CRV and will not include either asset. Proposal. This proposal approves the following changes: I. Increase the target collateral ratio to 100% This is the long-term target of the protocol and will require time to reach. No FXS will be minted to achieve this target. As part of this change, the protocol is retiring the algorithmic backing of FRAX and the decollateralize function. II. Retain protocol revenue to fund the increased CR, including pausing FXS buybacks. veFXS yield remains the same. III. Authorize up to $3m per month in frxETH purchases to increase the CR. _________ - For - Approve the changes described above, including setting the long term target CR of Frax to 100% - Against - Do nothing. _________________________________________\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHV5ItXpTGlBaxhQblS8BhresaA", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954189, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests increasing the target collateral ratio (CR) of the Frax protocol to 100% over time.

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-03-05. Abstract. [After the ARC stage community discussions reached consensus.]([link]) This ARFC proposal outlines a finalized offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The plan aims to reduce the amount of liquidity in BUSD and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins. The plan involves modification of BUSD risk parameters. The plan will be enforced in a single AIP. Motivation. Paxos recently stopped the minting of BUSD due to recent developments with the SEC. This will result in the circulating supply of BUSD trending towards zero over time. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The resulting APR cost of the plan, if enforced today, would be 101.25% for current borrowers, signaling them to repay without significant impact on their positions. If the reserve utilization reaches 100%, the resulting APR cost will be 210% The ACI has analyzed the vBUSD debt token holders and found that most top positions are relatively active addresses and are expected to manage their positions actively. The ACI would like to express its gratitude to all participants for providing valuable feedback during the discussions and @bgdlabs for providing valuable tooling support for rateStrategy simulations. Implementation. The offboarding plan will be carried out in a single AIP with the following parameters: - Decrease uOptimal from 80% to 20% - Increase reserveFactor from 10% to 99.9% - Increase base rate from 0% to 3% - Increase slope 1 from 4% to 7% - Increase slope 2 from 100% to 200% Process. The community has reached a consensus on this plan after valuable participant feedback during the ARC stage. Disclamer.

Zane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Jordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Summary. Deploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team. Match CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools. Metronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite. Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS. Background and Motivation. [Metronome]([link]) is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project [Vesper]([link]) - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle) Metronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on. Specifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a \"yield-plus experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY) Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an \"msETH synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today. This mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome) In return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities. Section 0: Pool Deployment. Frax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight. Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget. Frax team will match any CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months) up to 165,000 CVX. Metronome treasury currently holds [roughly 165,000 CVX]([link]) These rewards may be split between msUSD-FraxBP and msETH-frxETH at the discretion of both teams, but intention will be to maintain a generalized 1:1 CVX match across that timespan. This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges. Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper. Currently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome. Metronome will initially expand to support sfrxETH, enabling users to loop their position against msETH mintage (or msUSD) to multiply their APY. Vesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include: Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX Future strategies as they become available. The Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral. Section 3: Program Extension. The above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS. In particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY. Should there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program. In addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome. In the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains. Lastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO. Summary. Prioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome. Frax to match CVX voting weight with Metronome, up-to Metronomes 165,000 CVX stake, for four voting cycles. Frax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways: New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders. Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions. Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on.

We propose to build a dedicated analytics dashboard for the 1inch ecosystem, allowing users to analyze the protocols main KPIs, activity, treasury, and token related metrics. This proposal is coming along after several meetings with 1inch core team. We determined the requirements scope and technical design together. Abstract. The dashboard will allow anyone in the community to browse the protocols treasury, KPIs, token metrics, and transactions. The dashboard will initially support the following chains: - Ethereum. - Polygon. - Avalanche. - Arbitrum. - Optimism. - BSC Dashboard will be served on a dedicated web app. Motivation. - Make the protocols key information as accessible and transparent as possible. - Help governance and users with decision-making. - Provide more thorough information than currently available on Dune (i.e breakdown per user, search tooling) Specification. This dashboard will be built using the Dune API as a data source. Data from Dune will then be indexed on an intermediate database for easy and quick access. We propose to create the following subsections for the dashboard: Homepage (Protocol KPIs) The UI would be somewhat similar to this: [[link]]([link]) - Users. - DAU, WAU, MAU. - Cumulative user count. - Transactions. - Daily, weekly and month trade count. - Breakdown of the number of trades per DEX. - Volume. - Daily volume, weekly volume, monthly volume. - Average trade size (daily, weekly, monthly) - Median trade size (daily, weekly, monthly) - Volume by underlying liquidity source. 1inch Fusion. - 1inch Fusion KPIs. - Total orders, volume, unique users (current + historical) - Latest and top transactions. - Explore and compare resolvers. - Search by address. - Compare and access all resolvers in a leaderboard view - Sort by unicorn power, staked 1Inch, all-time fees, total orders, . - Breakdown per resolver (Total orders and volume, Historical orders and volume, Historical fees, Staked 1inch / unicorn power / lockout period) Treasury.

Dear all, as you know, the Gearbox Foundation (the \"Foundation) was established (you can learn more in this thread [link]([link])) In order for the Foundation to operate in the best possible way, the DAO has to decide on the major short-term and long-term assignments that will be given to the Foundation, allocation of resources, as well as other matters related to its operations. To accomplish this, we urge the community to engage in discussions and draft a GIP to be passed as a DAO resolution. The major items that we suggest to address are: a) Assignments, for example, IP management, source code licensing, manage and maintain subscriptions with third-party services such as hostings, email providers, etc.; b) Allocation of a budget in USDC/T that can cover the operational expenses of the Foundation during a particular term, for example, 12 months; c) Appointment of representatives, committees, or sub-DAOs who can exercise the DAOs rights and act as its representatives in discussions with the Foundation regarding specific subjects (so that theres no need for the DAO to pass separate resolutions on such subjects as its representatives can provide respective instructions) To help in this process, we have prepared a draft GEAR DAO Resolution, which can serve as a basis or sample for a DAO resolution to be adopted. GEAR DAO RESOLUTION. By this action, the GEAR DAO (the \"DAO) hereby adopts the following resolutions and takes the following actions with regard to the Gearbox Foundation (the \"Foundation): 1. Long-Term Assignments.

To date, the DAOs practice is to set the exact dates for each upcoming Season during the final weeks of the current season, which are then ratified by the community via Snapshot. This has shown to be an error-prone and inefficient practice which negatively impacts planning in teams across the DAO. This bDIP seeks to set season length at 16 weeks and designate formal downtime between each, to commence in 2024 following two adjusted seasons for the remainder of 2023. BDIP BACKGROUND. In February 2022, the Forum proposal titled[The Super Season: Proposing a 6-month season between April and October 2]([link]) suggested a one-off, six-month super season' to address perceived issues associated with a three-month season, specifically that budget planning \" four times per year . expends tons of bandwidth that could be going toward working on and in the organization. While there was general agreement for the concept of a super season, with 52% voting in favour and a further 26% voting for \"maybe, with edits, there was also positive support (10 likes) for a comment suggesting a 16-week season instead. In March 2022 the original proposal author created a new proposal titled[4-Month Season Proposal: SuperSeason Revisions 2]([link]), which stated that \"Based on discussions in the seasons channel and feedback from many contributors, a four-month season (16-weeks) seems to be a happy medium. Despite 93% of the 30 voters being in favour, no action was taken. Its possible that inaction was due to the timing of the proposal which suggested implementation within a few weeks' time. These proposals occurred prior to the existence of the DAO Constitution and during a period of confusion around Forum and Snapshot quorum thresholds, which may also be a contributing factor in the lack of progression. BDIP SPECIFICATION. |Current Form|Proposal| | --- | --- | |Section: DAO Cycles -[Seasons 1]([link])|Section: DAO Cycles -[Seasons 1]([link]) |Seasons are funding cycles (typically 3 months) intended to align the DAOs collective energy to key objectives. These objectives are in the form of funded initiatives BANK token holders vote on before each season.|Seasons are funding cycles (each set at 16 weeks) which are intended to align the DAOs collective energy to key objectives. These objectives are in the form of funded initiatives voted on by BANK token holders before each season. Between seasons, the DAO schedules designated Gap Weeks' and an Annual Break' in order to respect the need for contributors to rest. |Section: DAO Organizational Units -[Grants Committee 2]([link]): | Section: DAO Organizational Units -[Grants Committee 2]([link]):| |Grants Leads serve a 6-month term and can resign at any time.| Grants Leads serve a 2-season term and can resign at any time.| |Section: DAO Organizational Units -[Grants Committee 2]([link]): | Section: DAO Organizational Units -[Grants Committee 2]([link]):| |Grants Reviewers serve a 6-month term and can resign at any time.|Grants Reviewers serve a 2-season term and can resign at any time.| The textual change to the Constitution is minimal in terms of word count but high-impact in terms of operational change. However, given that this change does not alter the DAOs activities or priorities, only the way in which our time is allocated, it is therefore designated as a Minor change. Further, it should be noted here and in any subsequent Snapshot vote that the update to the Constitution will only truly reflect DAO practice from 2024, due to the suggested adjustment period to cover the remainder of 2023. Therefore this bDIP seeks not only a change to the Constitution wording in two places (as specified below), but also community consensus to specify season dates for the remainder of 2023 and thereafter as listed below. This is to ensure that the DAO can commence the 16-week season structure from January 2, 2024. Although the Constitution will not specify season dates for 2023, 2024, or subsequent years, the intention of this proposal is to gain consensus to commence Week 1 of the relevant season on January 2 (UTC) of any year, regardless of what day of the week that falls. The season dates do not need to change thereafter, only the days of the week on which they fall will change. As a global organisation that promotes work-life balance and flexibility for contributors, the DAO does not need to stick to the traditional approach that all working weeks begin on a Monday. Beginning in 2024, and starting each year from January 2, the seasons would run for 16 weeks, with a one-week designated Gap Week between the first and second seasons, and another Gap Week between the second and third. Between the third season and the first season of the new calendar year there would be a 16-day designated Annual Break. The Gap Weeks and Annual Break are opportunities to pause official events and encourage contributors to take a break. Teams within the DAO will have the ability to plan for budgeting and operational needs for these periods and may decide for themselves which activities should continue through breaks, if any. The dates below provide a plan for the remainder of 2023 and the dates for 2024. Thereafter, each DAO year will start on January 2 and the season dates will be the same. The dates are intentionally omitted from the proposed Constitution wording because constitutions should capture high-level principles, not operational details. Please understand that if you vote to approve then you are signalling your approval of the dates as well as the Constitution change. The Plan. According to the Snapshot vote titled[Season 7 Specification and Community-Indicated Direction 1]([link]), Season 7s designated Gap Week finishes on Sun, May 14, 2023. Proposed Season Dates for 2023 (Seasons 8 and 9) Season 8: Mon, May 15 - Sun, August 27 (15 weeks) Gap Week: Mon, August 28 - Sun, Sept 3 (1 week) Season 9: Mon, Sept 4 - Sun, Dec 17 (15 weeks) Annual Break: Mon, Dec 18 2023- Mon, January 1 2024 (15 days) Season Dates for 2024 (based on the specification detailed above) Season 10: Tues January 2 - Mon April 22 (16 weeks) Gap Week: Tues April 23 - Mon April 29 (1 week) Season 11: Tues April 30 - Mon Aug 19 (16 weeks) - Week 1 would incorporate bDAO anniversary Gap Week: Tues Aug 20 - Mon Aug 26 (1 week) Season 12: Tues Aug 27 - Mon Dec 16 (16 weeks) Annual Break: Tues Dec 17 - Wed January 1 2025 (16 days) 2025 seasons begin on Thurs Jan 2. 2026 seasons begin on Fri Jan 2. . and so on. EXPECTED IMPACT. As noted above, the textual change to the Constitution is minimal but this is a highly impactful positive operational change for the DAO. It is anticipated that hundreds of hours will be saved through the designation of set seasonal dates, particularly in workstreams associated with: Guild and Department role elections and budget planning. Project budget planning. Seasonal budgets assessment and approval (Grants Committee) Seasonal planning (operations) Season launch planning (marketing and design) In addition, teams will be better able to plan contributor coverage for operational needs during Gap Weeks and Annual Breaks, whilst also recognising that contributors may also decide to take personal time away from the DAO at any time of the year. Having set dates for the year ahead enables productive discussions at team level about appropriate time away. ANALYTICS. The DAO-wide sentiment survey could be used to collect feedback on the change.

This is done through Messaris Protocol Services, which is separate from Messari Enterprise, the entirety of our work is funded through project grants enabling us to make it all publicly available. Messari Protocol Services believes in the power and importance of transparency and education in DeFi. Protocols enable permissionless networks, and DAOs manage the parameters and designs of the protocol and related token. Both users and members of the DAO benefit from deep data research and communication. Messari PS hires and trains analysts to become a productive member of DAO communities and experts in the protocols they cover, enabling them to help surface key data and events to the largest distribution of crypto users, investors, and builders available. DeFi, and crypto in general, requires unbiased third parties to work with communities to surface transparent, detailed, and digestible information about the protocol and DAO. Messari PS is the leading provider for that solution. For an update from our [prior proposal]([link]), as a company Messari has 3x our headcount with a team of over 150 after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard Digital. We've used that to significantly scale our research, data science, and engineering resources to build out our quarterly reporting and research capabilities. This has enabled us to bring all of our research in-house so we can have dedicated sector-specific analysts assigned to each protocol to cover them each quarter and continue to build up expertise. We have become core subgraph developers for The Graph and are building out open-source data infrastructure that feeds into our quarterly reports and live data dashboards. Lastly, we have been working extensively on growing our distribution and have signed deals to redistribute quarterly reports with Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Refinitiv three of the largest tradfi research platforms in the world. ![[image]]([link]) Existing Work: Quarterly reports [State of Balancer Q1]([link]) [State of Balancer Q2]([link]) [State of Balancer Q3]([link]) [State of Balancer Q4]([link]) Data Analytics and Infrastructure [Subgraphs]([link]) (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon) [Protocol Metrics dashboard]([link]) [Balancer Dune Dashboard]([link]) Governance Messari Governor [coverage]([link]) tracking, summarizing, categorizing over 300 proposals Two long-form proposal summaries related to Balancer DAO and its products: [Governor Note: The veBAL Wars]([link]) [Governor Note: Introducing Staked aTokens]([link]) Other Contributions: First veBAL value statement veBAL unlock schedule Featured pool analyses 3rd party qualitative analysis on major DAO debates and decisions and protocol changes Multiple engagements in the forum Participating in monthly SP calls Participating in Governance Twitter spaces. Note: Everything listed above is freely accessible Proposal Breakdown: Quarterly Reporting. We will produce 4 quarterly reports following the same cadence released shortly after the end of the fiscal quarter. These will break down major KPIs and fundamental metrics such as: Aggregate stats - protocol revenue, veBAL distribution, BL incentives, operating margins Dex metrics - trading volume, liquidity, new pools LP metrics - LP fees, annualized yield. We will look at these from both the macro level and on a more granular level from individual pool level data and network deployments. The data will come from the publicly available subgraphs and Dune dashboards we've built. Data Analytics. We've already released freely available [data dashboards]([link]) showing many of the metrics included in the quarterly reports. We plan to extend this by building an advanced LP analytics page showing: Pool rankings based on. Liquidity, trading volume, revenue, capital efficiency, revenue/$ of TVL Profitability calculator. Pool returns split out by swap fees and reward emissions Backtesting of different LP positions Simulating future returns Help user in finding best pools based on their LP profile. Shortlist pools to LP on based on LP profile and preferences. Track performance of LP positions over time. Compare across different deployments and different pools. Governance Analysis A Bi-Annual Governance Report. Messari will create bi-annual reports to analyze key governance KPIs and metrics and a detailed look into governance structure, process, dynamics, and analysis. (ex: [Optimism]([link])) Details include: Introduction. Balancer Structure and Process Updates. Quantitative Analysis. veBAL Distribution. Power Dynamics (Voter blocs, whales, voter history, etc.) Proposal Analysis (Proposal history, success rate, participation metrics, categorization, etc.) Qualitative Analysis. Governance Design. Structure/Process Analysis. Quorum Analysis. Exploration of governance opportunities. Proposal Analysis. Highlight of contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events. Conclusion Retainer for a Balancer Governor Note. A 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis designed to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals. Key Objectives & Success Metrics: 1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments. Crypto has a glaring lack of sufficient long-form research and analytics. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels to distill information, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of the on-chain activity and important protocol-level developments. This creates a high barrier to making informed decisions as a stakeholder, leading to a misallocation of resources, both time and money, since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal. These services will inform various stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate these stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of Balancer. 2. Growth. Not only are we creating these reports but we're ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messaris channels of 300,000 crypto-natives, which reach most of the active builders and investors in the industry as well as through our distribution through some of the largest traditional research platforms in the world: Bloomberg Terminal: 325,000 users. S&P Global Capital IQ: 12,000 enterprises. Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters): 40,000 enterprises and 400,000 users. This goes a long way to further professionalize Balancer to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity to the protocol. ![[image]]([link]) ![[image]]([link]) A note on success metrics. Given the nature of this proposal, it can be difficult to directly attribute benefits. For example, you can have institutional players consuming reports on Bloomberg and using that as a key part of their diligence to allocate capital however its not possible to say $x of liquidity or investment came in as a result of Messari Research. While we know this is happening anecdotally we can't tangibly measure it. Length of Engagement & Budget: edit: We propose the base quarterlies option for the current cycle: $80k total. a. 4 Quarterly reports. b. at least one tweet on each quarterly report. c. AMA with the DAO on SP calls about quarterly take-aways and inspo for new analysis. Payment can be made in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment (in which case there will be a 5% premium to account for additional costs of accepting native tokens) In both cases the funds will go towards: Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. Data Science and Engineering - Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. Distribution - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messaris channels along with the third-party partners.

The projects outlined in Olympus DAOs 2023 product delivery lineup are all huge steps forward in building out the OHM ecosystem, but the current staking model is not really compatible with them. Specifically, staking acts as an unnecessary hurdle for these projects to clear. We should have a plan in place to encourage transitioning from staking to these new products as they go live. There are three Options below, which range from gentle to aggressive in terms of transition speed. Option 1: One-time OHM bond as a temporary replacement. Steps taken: - Wait until lending AMO test is concluded, and for Flex Loan and alOHM have decent alternatives. - Issue a single bond market at fixed 7.33% to mature in 6 months. - After bond market closes, begin turning staking to 0 (cliff or slower decline tbd) The problem solved: Several projects are more complicated to complete due to staking existing and the gOHM tokens ubiquity: OHM bonds, on chain gov, LP farming, and lending OHM for example. However, moving staking to zero now without an acceptable replacement risks a very poor user experience with no solid timeframe for improvement. The compromise is to use an OHM bond to fill the gap while these projects are being worked on. Users who want \"simple yield can get into the bond. Meanwhile the \"use case projects are easier to complete since they don't have to compete with gOHM anymore. Option 1 Pros: - Projects have better chance of success and are simpler to execute. - Lowers emissions now; saves potentially $millions in OHM emissions. - Maintains a base use case for users; \"softens the blow. - \"Forces users to search out better yield opportunities and use their OHM. Option 1 Cons: - More complicated to manage vs keeping staking around. - Requires partnership buy-in (flex loans, alOHM, Euler/Silo) - Potentially high dev effort to make fixed rate OHM bond at scale. - High user effort; must unstake and move to OHM bond to maintain yield. - Potential for above average sell off on maturity. - Short term solution that will need addressing in a fixed time frame. Option 2: Wait to touch staking until suitable alternative projects are completed. Steps taken: - Wait until the following projects are implemented and successful: Lending. Leverage. LP farming. OHM bond vaults. Once the above list is satisfied, reduce staking to 0% The problem solved: Staking is the core of the protocol currently, and gOHM is everywhere. Killing gOHMs \"simple yield option before alternatives arise is a surefire way to put the protocol in a bad position. We need to give the market time to find other solutions organically. We shouldn't ram through massive changes without having solid solutions in place first. Option 2 Pros: - Simple, \"wait and see approach. - Low risk of community disillusion with yet another change, Gives community plenty of time to warm up and embrace the idea. - Gives partners plenty of time to find alternative yield paths. Option 2 Cons: - High cost in emissions vs ending staking sooner, potentially in the $millions. - Does not solve the issue of staking cannibalizing on the success of other alternative projects (OHM bonds for example) - Impacts the likelihood of users seeking out of alternative yield sources while they are being rolled out (think: lending, LPing, or things under discussion like a passive OHM pool for Gearbox) - Potentially negative feedback loop of \"wait and see, but the problem could be staking so we never get to see. Option 3: Stepwise staking reduction. Steps taken: - Wait until Lending AMO test is finished (a few weeks, target completion is Week 13) - Reduce staking to 2.33% - Wait until the projects list from Option 2 is complete. - Reduce staking to 0% The problem solved: This option is a bit of a compromise between the two other ones. Its less risky than Option 1 while still reducing the long term protocol cost. Its \"smarter than Option 2 while still avoiding complexity. Option 3 Pros: - Relatively simple. - Lowers cost to the protocol. - Allows other projects to somewhat breathe and buys them time to be successful before fully killing staking. Option 3 Cons: - Kicks the can down the road, doesn't fully simplify other projects like OHM bonds. - Does not solve for gOHM token making other projects more complex (like on chain gov) - Doesn't save as much as Option 1\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHmaMdyZxNsE2NSCFsTOLB69WsK", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954206, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal aims to make the currently unproductive staked OHM more productive by encouraging users to transition to new projects in the Olympus DAO ecosystem.

On February 16, 2023 at approximately 7 PM UTC, Platypus Finance, a stableswap protocol on Avalanche, was exploited through a flaw in its USP stablecoin solvency check mechanism and resulted in 9 million in stablecoins stolen from the users and pool depositors of the protocol in a series of three attacks. In one of the three attacks, the attacker mistakenly implemented a logic in the exploit contract such that around $381k worth of stablecoins were directly transferred to Aave V3s Pool contract deployed on Avalanche. Currently, the Pool contract has implemented a 'rescueTokens' function, which will allow the function caller, who must be granted the 'Pool_Admin' role in Aave V3s access control system, to transfer any stuck ERC-20 tokens to designated addresses, including the stablecoins transferred to the Pool contract by the attacker. This ARC is inspired by the previous discussions between Aave contributors, the Platypus team & its community, and various blockchain security organizations and individuals on the possible recovery of the funds sent to the Pool contract. This ARCs objective is to gather community sentiment and consensus to form and publish a formal AIP proposal vote for a community vote to approve the recovery actions on the stolen user assets stuck in the Pool contract. To be discussed and decided: The technical implementation of the recovery actions: Platypus team and the Aave core contributors will work on a recovery contract to call the 'rescueTokens' function of the Pool contract and transfer the exploited funds stuck in the Pool contract to Platypus teams multi-sig, subject to governance voting which will grant the recovery contract the 'Pool_Admin' role access. The contract will follow Aaves 'StewardBase' pattern, which specifies the logic for handling Aaves Pool access control logic and automatically renounce the admin roles once the recovery actions are fully executed. ARC content in short Platypus/ Aave team to deploy a recovery contract with the sole goal to recover exploited assets stuck in Aave V3s Pool contract.

Title: [ARFC] Proposal for Deploying \"Whitelabel Aave V3 Market for RealT Tokens on GnosisChain. Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Date: 2023-02-15. . Summary: Realt is a Real Estate tokenization protocol that enables users to gain exposure to real estate properties that produce rent income directly paid on-chain. The RMM (RealT Market Maker) market based on Aave V2 has already reached ~10M$ in size since its launch. This ARFC proposes deploying a \"whitelabel version of Aave V3 for RealT tokens on the Gnosis Chain network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams. Motivation: The quality of the Aave V3 codebase has made it a recognizable and trustworthy asset in the DeFi community as illustrated by spark protocol recent ARC 7. Therefore, rather than \"reinventing the wheel, many projects are interested in deploying \"friendly forks of V3 that fit their own models. Aave is currently \"delegating off-chain collaterals to third parties, such as the Centrifuge RWA market, but this might change mid-term with GHO and off-chain collateral facilitators. At present, Aave is immature in this area, so allowing third parties to deploy these \"friendly forks or Aave whitelabel deployments can increase Aave technology adoption. RealT proposes a 20% profit-sharing arrangement with the Aave DAO for this deployment. In this context, \"profit refers to the assets redirected to the RMM collector contract via the reserveFactor collection from users having borrow positions on this market. Quarterly, Realt will deliver 20% of the balance of this contract to the Aave Ethereum collector contract 7. In the case of a future Aave V3 deployment on the Gnosis Chain, RealT will be able to implement a more automatic and decentralized way to deliver the revenue share to an Aave collector contract on the Gnosis Chain. This would allow for more seamless and efficient profit-sharing arrangements between RealT and Aave. While the RealT market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the RMM market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols. Specification: No on-chain AIP or technical implementation is required for this ARFC. Therefore, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon. Disclaimer: The Aave-Chan Initiative is not linked nor paid by RealT to publish this ARFC.

GotchiID: 16559, 2824. Hello frens, We would like to put forward our own proposal that we believe is the fairest way to allocate the funds whilst also protecting asset holders. We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO. The split would be as follows: Liquidity: 25% The DAO: 25% Pixelcraft: 25% Protocol rewards: 25% By protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. A yes vote for protocol rewards in this case does not mean a yes vote for ongoing RF in its current iteration, it protects funds to be used to make sure that protocol assets remain liquid and sufficiently included in the economic cycle/paradigm going forward. A yes vote for protocol rewards signals to loyal supporters of the protocol that the original vision remains intact, rather than being diverted into new and unproven games and business models. Without inclusion/correlation between GHST and assets, great economic disruption could follow the turning off of curve for asset owners. A stream of funding protocol rewards for two years not only creates an ongoing source of buy side liquidity for the GHST token, it also allows market participants to trust in the correlation between GHST and protocol assets. As we prepare to release the Forge and GBM different assets, we have the choice to signal to market participants whether they are bidding into a single RF season, or towards inclusion in the economic benefits of the platform for a full two years from here.

Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting ACI and 3SE. Dated: 2023-02-18. --- Summary. This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard SNX to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. Synthetix is financial primitive enabling the creation of synthetic assets, offering unique derivatives and exposure to real-world assets on the blockchain. SNX was originally listed on Aave v1 and included on Aave v2 when it was launched in late 2020. Adding SNX to Aave v3 will enable users to migrate from v2 to v3, $10.5m, and enable Aave to continue generating SNX nominated revenue. SNX is not currently listed on either the USDC or ETH Compound v3 liquidity market. This ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting. Motivation. Synthetics has $435m of TVL and is [ranked 25]([link]) on the Defi Llama dashboard. Aave has generated over $205,000 in revenue from users who borrow SNX on Aave v2. SNX is one of the few non stable coin tokens with significant borrowing demand. The risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlets original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations]([link]) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote. The interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don't create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates. We note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot. Specification. Ticker: SNX.

Discourse Thread: [link] Important note: Currently there is $38M of DAI in the curve contract, 30% more than when sigprop went live, so we are asking for a bit more funds than in sigprop ($4M increased to $5M) This increase allows us to increase the liquidity on the DEXs a little more and not end up with cash intended for liquidity that would end up lying idle. Hello Frens! The core proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25/25/25/25% split is likely to pass. One of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery. At the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the impermanent loss risks when the curve will close. The liquidity provision will be split in 2 plans: - Pre-curve plan: Ensure high liquidity for the curve transition. - Post-curve plan: Buyback (protocol rewards), DAO treasury management, liquidity reallocations after price discovery. In the sigprop we had asked to secure $4M for the pre-curve plan while having fairly approximate plans, so after discussions with Balancer and Quickswap we are coming back with a more detailed plan. This core-prop only discusses the pre-curve plan to ensure liquidity on DEXs. We have a liquidity target of around $5M+, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage. PRE-CURVE PLAN: DEXs: Quickswap and Balancer. BALANCER LIQUIDITY PROVISION : We have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmys 110k) To add DAO liquidity, we chose an 80(GHST)-20(Stable) type pool. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, this type of pool looks quite interesting. To use 950k DAI in the Balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.50: 80-20 pool: 2560000 GHST (4,750,000$ pool total) This liquidity injection must occur 3 days before the close of the curve. Bribes program: It is possible for the DAO to deploy 6M DAI (this number depends on the number of DAI at the close of the curve) on Balancer and earn 5% (~300k annual) + 5-6% BAL rewards. (For the rest of the calculation we will take the worst case: 5% APY total on the DAI => 300k$/year) Then we can use the 300k+ in DAI rewards to bribe the 80-20 GHST-STABLE pool, giving the DAO more rewards. This allows us to yield on our treasury and not let it sleep without yield. Bribes are done via Snapshot, which will require regular participation between our Snapshot DAO and Balancer. QUICKSWAP V3 LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM : To achieve the liquidity target, we believe that a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO is worthwhile. We are targeting $3M+ in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require 160,000 GHST in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $4 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program must begin 3 days before the curve closes and last for 2 months. We expect between 10% and 20% of the GHST amount in Quick rewards from Quickswap team for the liquidity mining rewards on their V3 (full range liquidity) For technical reasons, we cannot add all these rewards to the existing GLTR staking contract. So liquidity providers will have to choose between the GLTR rewards and the GHST + Quick rewards. So, to summarize, we are asking the DAO to add 2,560,000 GHST with the 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury to a 80-20 Balancer pool. This pool will be bribed by the DAO through treasury management thereafter. This provision of liquidity by the DAO will allow the DAO to earn swap fees and BAL rewards thus obtaining more cash flow. In addition to these numbers, we are asking the DAO to sponsor a Quickswap LM program with 160,000 GHST. Doing a liquidity program can be smarter in high volatility times because a 50-50 pool is very prone to impermanent losses, and we prefer incentive liquidity rather than having the DAO lose money through IL.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHmHVK0jGXCDL02WZkLX9CgbG0z", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954206, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal is to allocate funds to improve liquidity and ensure a smooth price discovery for new entrants in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.

To match this, approve the minting of up to $5m in OHM for this vault in order for both assets to be deployed in a 50/50 liquidity pool. Background. The Boosted Liquidity Engine (BLE) leverages Olympus' competitive advantages (monetary policy flexibility and treasury strength) to mint OHM into liquidity pools with select high quality assets. LPs bring an asset (e.g., stablecoin, LSD) into newly developed vaults and the Olympus treasury mints OHM in equal value (for 50/50 pools) to match and create a complete LP position. LPs benefit from boosted liquidity mining opportunities and partner protocols are able to more efficiently drive liquidity mining programs and deepen supplemental liquidity for their tokens. Olympus benefits from LPs providing counter asset liquidity, enhancing OHMs liquidity depth, which enables greater utility and stability. Furthermore, the BLE can be a powerful tool for partnerships. BLE is not intended to be utilized for any and all assets but rather select high-quality assets with which an OHM pairing would be beneficial. For more information on the Boosted Liquidity Engine please refer to OIP-131. Vault Details. The wstETH/OHM vault will be the first deployment of a BLE. As third parties add wstETH into the vault, the protocol will mint OHM to match this and deploy it into the liquidity pool and stake it to receive incentives. All the reward tokens earned through this vault will be directed to wstETH depositors.

Angle Protocol is governed by veANGLE holders who vote on Snapshot for protocol improvement decisions. Finalized votes are then implemented by a 4/6 multi-sig composed of community members. This multisig, deployed on all chains where the protocol is live natively, has the ownership on many of the smart contracts of the protocol. Proposal. Proposal is to give ownership across all the contracts of the protocol to the Timelock contract, and make the owner of this Timelock contract the existing 4/6 governance multisig. The way future proposals would be executed with this setup is the following: 1. Vote happens on Snapshot. 2. If good on Snapshot, the transaction payload is sent to the Timelock contract by the 4/6 governance multisig (which is the only address able to queue payloads to the system) 3. Once the timelock delay is over, anyone can execute the transaction. We propose as such to set the delay to 48 hours. Implementation. Implementation suggested for the Timelock contract is that of OpenZeppelin 'TimelockControllerUpgradeable' It will be first set so that only the governance multisig can add payloads to the timelock.

Contributors: N/A. Status: Snapshot-only vote. Date Posted: 2023-02-16 References [link] Simple Summary. This proposal aims to introduce a Hop Ambassador Program; Hop DAO Ambassadors would participate in DAO Governance across the ecosystem on behalf of the Hop Protocol; these ambassadors would also pursue partnership and integration opportunities within other DAO Communities; this proposal lays down the operational aspects of how this ambassador program would function on behalf of the Hop Protocol. Motivation. The Hop Protocol plays a vital role in the ecosystem through its bridging Infrastructure. It has become imperative that Hop Protocol is represented in some strategic DAOs across the ecosystem. Through this ambassador program, members of the Hop Community with the highest context in the selected DAOs can represent the Hop Protocol in these DAOs, ultimately creating value for the Hop Protocol. Specification. Eligibility. Any member of the Hop DAO Community is eligible to become a Hop DAO Ambassador. However, such an individual must show that they are an active community member in the particular DAO they wish to represent the Hop DAO in. How many Ambassadors will the Hop DAO select? For the initial pilot program, the Hop DAO will have three ambassadors who will represent the Hop DAO in Optimism which the Hop DAO already has delegated governance power. We suggest starting with three ambassadors since there seems to be a fair amount of interest here. This provides an unequal number, helping to combat any deadlock decisions that may occur in optimism governance votes. For the other communities, this presents an opportunity for Hop DAO to establish itself in other communities. Nomination and Elections. Hop DAO Ambassadors will serve for one year, after which the role becomes vacant. After a year, eligible individuals are welcome to nominate themselves and subsequently become elected to the role. At the expiration of the one-year term, a forum thread shall be opened by one member of the outgoing Hop DAO Ambassadors; then prospective Ambassadors would nominate themselves under the thread; the nomination post shall contain the following information: 1. Details about the DAO they wish to represent the Hop DAO in. 2. The value that Hop DAO could derive from participating in the DAO. 3. What makes the prospective Ambassador the best fit for the role; After one week, the thread shall stop accepting nominations, and the nominees shall be posted on Snapshot for the community to elect three Ambassadors to represent the DAO. Previous Ambassadors shall remain eligible to hold the position again by following the nomination and election process. Duties of a Hop DAO Ambassador. These ambassadors would be responsible for the following: 1. Governance Participation through Voting and Proposal Writing: Ambassadors will participate in governance by voting on proposals, communicating their rationale, and writing proposals. 2. Seeking Business Development Opportunities through Integrations: An ambassador could potentially broker a discussion in another DAO that would lead to an asset being added to the Hop Protocols list of supported assets; an example would be rETH getting listed as a supported asset on the Hop Protocol. 3. Increasing Hop Protocols Governance Power in selected Protocols: An Ambassador would start out as a delegate in a protocol and, over time, increase their governance power on behalf of the Hop DAO. 4. Attending Community Calls of the Selected DAOs, and also attending the Hop DAOs' community call: Forming a strong tie with a DAOs community is an important aspect of participation. Ambassadors must attend the DAOs community call and also attend the Hop Community call. This way, they have an opportunity to provide feedback to the community that they represent. Compensation. Hop Ambassadors will receive Vested HOP every 6 months, to keep the Ambassadors aligned with Hop DAO. This means an ambassador will receive $3,000 every 6 months as a lump sum, rather than on a monthly basis. If an ambassador is removed before their term reaches 6 months, they will not be compensated for their work. Program Cost In its current state, if we have three ambassadors for Optimism, that will cost the DAO $18,000 annually. $500 x 3 x 12 Months = $18,000. Removing an ambassador. Any member of the community who believes that an Ambassador does not well represent the Hop DAO will have the right to put up a proposal requesting that the Ambassador be removed and immediately replaced. This forum post must contain proof of neglect of assigned duties or proof of improper actions which could misrepresent the Hop DAO; these actions or inactions must also be directly related to the duties assigned to the ambassador by this proposal. These actions could be a failure to; vote, communicate rationale or attend community calls. Delegate Thread. Each Ambassador shall maintain a delegate thread on the Hop forum for the DAO the ambassador participates in on behalf of Hop DAO. The thread shall contain the ambassadors votes and the decision and rationale for every vote. I.e. Vote: [Yes/No/Abstain/Missed] Rationale: Quarterly Report. Every quarter, each ambassador shall post a Quarterly Report of its activities within the quarter. This report will include the following: Hop Protocols Governance Power (Changes) Number of votes done by the ambassador (including any missed vote) Proposals are written by the ambassador Progress of business development opportunities. Selected DAOs for the Pilot. To kick off the Pilot Phase of the Hop DAO Ambassador Programs operations, we propose starting with: Optimism: Because OP Governance Power has been delegated to the Hop DAO, and the fundamental role that Hop Protocol plays in the ecosystem, participating in OP Governance is an essential first step for the ambassador. Note: The community shall select the other two DAOs depending on the Ambassadors they choose to elect. Review If this proposal is successful, we suggest that we do a DAO-wide review in 6 months to evaluate this pilot program before moving forward. Conclusion The Hop DAO occupies a very important role in the ecosystem. The Hop Protocol has many stakeholders across the ecosystem. As we build out the Hop Protocol Roadmap, our increased participation in the ecosystem will be vital in establishing key partnerships and identifying opportunities for possible integrations. These efforts to participate in governance and pursue partnership opportunities across the ecosystem will ultimately compound into value for the Hop DAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHlX4tofOmayVUBmYf8ajK8toX4", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954205, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests creating a Hop Ambassador Program, where ambassadors from the Hop DAO community will represent the Hop Protocol in other DAO communities and help with governance and partnerships.

With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated]([link]) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1sand not just on Ethereum L2sis vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanches growing ecosystem. Proposal Motivation. The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M]([link]) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market. We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment]([link]), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system]([link]), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the futurebut for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution. Current State of Avalanche. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanches security. Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators' transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes) Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platforms [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32]([link])surpassing most other L1sand is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators]([link]) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked]([link]) The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1. The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereums L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security) Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnets validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network. Increased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama]([link]), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols. Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanches txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M]([link]) Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%]([link]) Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022]([link]), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust. Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM]([link]), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanches DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswaps dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible. Due to Uniswaps strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanchealthough Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providersand maybe token holderswill attain economic value from the protocols increased usage. Safety and Cross-Chain Governance. LayerZero Overview. We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum. The [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer]([link]) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passingwhich includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche. LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous othersit is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocols novel Ultra Light Node (ULN) Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlinksince they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity. LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZeros infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren't prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormholes $300M and Nomads $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs' future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times]([link]) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team. LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M]([link]) Future Bridge Alterations. Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setupbut that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the \"[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script]([link]) LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. Timeline. Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOHmmbtJJpU6hRPtPLg24f4W4Zz6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954206, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests deploying Uniswap v3 on the Avalanche blockchain to establish a strong presence on alternative Layer 1 chains.

GotchiID: 4563. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days. Final Discourse Thread: [link] Original Discourse Thread: [link] INTRODUCTION. AavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST Bonding Curve. This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAOs DAI stable coin. Closing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions. The Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today. \"The Curve is forever is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHSTs tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion. While MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the \"Endgame plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool. Even if one concludes that DAIs risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAIs depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable. Aavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own. AavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the companys readiness to also manage the DAI at scale. With nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC'd and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people! It is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve. Allocation of the Curves DAI. Turning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems. So far, the DAI in the Curves contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curves closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol. My originally paired Signal Proposal regarding allocation of DAI was voted down. However, another Signal Proposal written by Immaterial and Fantasma has passed with over 80% support. Titled \"25/25/25/25 split for curve DAI, that SigProp will be upgraded to CoreProp shortly after the publishing of this proposal you are now reading. IF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp passes alongside this proposal to close the curve, then DAI post-Curve closure shall be allocated in accordance with it. IF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp does not pass, but this proposal to close the curve does pass, Curves on-chain vote on Aragon will not happen until a new CoreProp regarding DAI allocation is passed. Process: Assuming both CoreProps pass, the process for our community to close the GHST Bonding Curve will happen in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps: Sunday, Feb 26. This CoreProp and a DAI distribution CoreProp must both pass in order to confirm AavegotchiDAOs intention and terms. If passed, the Aragon on-chain vote to close the GHST Bonding Curve begins in the days following shortly after. Achieving quorum on our on-chain vote requires 8% of total GHST supply to participate. That means GHST holders need to coordinate migrating GHST back to Ethereum between now and the vote so that we can honor the AGIP and successfully close the Curve. IF Aragon vote successfully closes the Curve: The Curve will immediately close, capping the supply of GHST. Any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the terms of the 25/25/25/25 AGIP. Risks. The risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes. Without deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market. There is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility. Benefits. The benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review: Remove all risk of Aavegotchis success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI) Complete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties. Improve GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time. Conclusion. For the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystems meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we've learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the visions development is completely within AavegotchiDAOs control. We are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Lets use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Consequently, this proposal has been modified from its original form to exclude the Ahbap donation and now calls for this to be sent to the BanklessDAOs Turkey Disaster Relief Fund._ Summary. This proposal calls for 1inch DAO to donate $100,000 USD towards humanitarian relief efforts in response to the [devastating earthquakes that struck Turkiye (Turkey) on February 6th, 2023]([link]) Abstract. This 1IP proposes a donation of $100,000 from the 1inch DAO treasury towards humanitarian relief efforts responding to the devastating earthquakes that occurred on 6 February 2023 in southern and central Turkey. This donation is intended to help save the lives of the victims who are facing severe shortages of food, shelter, medical supplies, clean water access, electricity supply disruption etc., due to extensive damage caused by these earthquakes. The donation will be split equally between Anka and BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund -- both projects have been vetted by the Ethereum community and the author. Motivation. This proposal seeks to express solidarity with those affected by this tragedy while also providing tangible support for ongoing relief efforts being carried out by non-profit organizations. By donating funds directly to these non-profits we can ensure our contribution will be used effectively where it matters most -- supporting people impacted across Turkiye. BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund is focused on humanitarian relief for those impacted by the earthquakes. They are thoroughly vetting several NGOs to distribute funds to. Anka is a crypto relief fund that was created to support the people of Turkiye after the disastrous earthquakes that hit the region. They have over 50 volunteers working on the project including a team located in Turkiye. Anka is committed to transparency and accountability. Specification. Send $100,000 of [1inch DAO Treasury]([link]) funds to the following causes: $50,000 in USDC to [BanklessDAOs Turkey Relief Fund]([link]) Ethereum (ERC20) Address -- [[hexadecimals]]([link]) $50,000 in USDC to [Anka]([link]) Ethereum (ERC20) Address -- [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Rationale. Given current estimates of over 20,000 fatalities, over 70,000 severe injuries, and several million displaced  there is an urgent need for immediate assistance. The faster we act, the more lives we potentially save. The donation must be made on-chain so that the funds can trustlessly be spent via a DAO vote. Considerations. From a security standpoint, there are no major implications associated with this proposal other than verifying that the Safesnap transaction data is correct. Though Syria was also affected by the earthquake, it is currently under international sanctions and has been omitted from this proposal. All funds will go to humanitarian efforts Turkiye.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request. 1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program: The main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO. Filling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases. For voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards. ![[image]]([link]) It is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program. 2) Smart Contract. The proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST. This proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production. The expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users: - Gelato automation tooling. - Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery. - Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks. - Toggling for slippage rate tolerance. - Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase. + potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities. Funding Request: We are seeking a separate request of $5000 DAI (or $5000 worth of $GHST) to complete this contract as it will require ongoing maintenance and wasn't anticipated in AGIP66 when the team was funded to conduct market research mainly.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOI2CnXLOFjm8Yjg0ho4TANV5mFg", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954222, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests creating a schedule to buy $GHST tokens for securing protocol rewards.

This a proposal to fund Nethermind to design white-labeling resistance mechanism. The delivery will include a detailed discussion of the final design and a systematization of knowledge for white-labeling prevention, oracle systems, prediction markets, and token-curated assets. During the project, a team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is, what solutions are or will be used in practice, and how. Then we will propose concrete mechanisms to make Lidos network white-labeling resistant. The project will be one of the steps toward enabling Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. This is a continuation of[the previous proposal]([link]) The project will take 22 weeks, and its cost  450 000 DAI  will be covered by Lido DAO. Proposer and work mindset. Proposer. Micha\u0142 Zaj\u0105c on behalf of Nethermind. About Nethermind. Nethermind is a team of world-class builders and researchers with expertise across several domains: Ethereum Protocol Engineering, Cryptography Research, Layer-2s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Miner Extractable Value (MEV), Smart Contract Development, Security Auditing, and Formal Verification, among others. Our Research team comprises computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers who work on analyzing, breaking, and designing blockchain and cryptographic schemes. Our expertise and interests span the fields of[zero-knowledge]([link])proofs, non-deterministic programming,[Distributed Validator Technology]([link]), and[decentralized identity]([link]) Working to solve some of the most challenging problems in the blockchain space, we frequently collaborate with renowned companies and DAOs, such as Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Lido Finance, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Flashbots, xDai, Open Zeppelin, Forta Protocol, Energy Web, POA Network and many more. We actively contribute to Ethereum core research and development, EIPs, and network upgrades with the Ethereum Foundation and other client teams. General work mindset. The following principles will drive the development of the protocols: - All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO. - All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols' security will be proven. - Milestones and deliverables will be small to ensure a good overview of the teams progress. Ideal mechanism overview. An ideal mechanism evaluates Lidos DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in[this note]([link]) by Lido. More precisely, the mechanism must have methods for improving the validator set if there is an option to do so. It must have zero input from permissioned roles (i.e., no admins/committees) Furthermore, it must have an input of low to zero impact from LDO, stETH, and ETH token holders. General objectives. We will assist Lido in creating and maintaining a permissionless and high-quality validator set mechanism. This entails: 1. Designing and implementing methods to ensure that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e., it does not hire a white-label operator), nor is secretly associated with other operators, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly. 2. Conducting a thorough economic analysis to understand how the market fluctuations, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can compromise the systems security. The project will be divided into following phases: - Phase 1:We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. This phase has been completed[already]([link]) - Phase 2:During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to white-labeling-protection. We will focus on arbiter protocols: oracles and prediction markets, to assess they usability in this problem. Then we will propose a mechanism that utilize an arbiter protocol to fight white-labeling. We will also investigate how to disincentivize using white labeling operators. The present proposal focuses solely on this phase. - Phase 2.5:We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the white-labeling prevention mechanism designed in Phase 2. - Phase 3:During this phase we will work on the Sybil resistance. We will prepare a survey on the state-of-the-art approaches and propose a mechanism that significantly increases the cost of creating Sybils. - Phase 3.5We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the Sybil prevention mechanism designed in Phase 3. - Phase 4: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1 to 4. - Phase 5:This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during the previous phases. We will also research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3. Project Objective. Phase 2. White-labeling resistance mechanism design. In this part of the project, we will focus on one of the crucial aspects of the security of a permissionless staking protocol. Namely ensuring that operators perform their duties independently and don't use third parties, so-called white-label operators, to do them on their behalf. An entity that runs multiple operators (whether by controlling Sybils or being a white-label operator) could have too much control over stake, and the protocol in general. This would worsen the overall health of the protocol, weaken its resistance against correlated slashing, and could introduce a single point of failure. We emphasize that even if we ensure that all onboarding operators are honest, we still need to have a system that detects dishonest parties within the set of already onboarded operators. This is because white-label operators can be created among the onboarded operators, even if these operators honestly entered the system. The latter may happen, e.g., when one entity that runs operators buys another that also runs operators. In that case, the buying party may end up controlling too much of the stake. Our work plan for developing the white-labeling resistance will begin by researching several techniques that, we believe, have the potential to lead to a solution in isolation or as part of an amalgam. The different types of methods we will explore are listed below. In particular, we will investigate arbiter protocols. The motivation for using arbiter protocols is following  a party that suspects that some operator is a white label could raise that issue and make a corresponding prediction market where people can bet on whether they believe in the claim. Then the conflict would be resolved by an assigned resolution mechanism. The final goal of our work will be to produce a report explaining exactly how the Lido network can use such methods. TASK 1White-labeling resistance. SoK. We will begin with supplementing the SoK from Phase 1 with an SoK for white-labeling resistance. We will look for such mechanisms used not only in Web3 but also in Web2 and, if necessary, real life. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 2 Arbiter protocols. SoK. We expect some core components to be decentralized oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets (with the focus on the last one) We will use these \"arbiter protocols, as we call them, to assess whether. - a prospective operator will provide good quality services and contribute to the quality of the operators' set or. - an already onboarded operator uses a white-label operator. As a first step, we will prepare an SoK for the following topics: - decentralized oracles. - prediction markets. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 3 Arbiter protocols. Resolution mechanisms. In this part, we will design a mechanism that resolves disputes in arbiter protocols. We will propose concrete setups for decentralized oracles and prediction markets. We will specify which parties make the oracle and who resolves disputes in prediction markets. We will analyze the feasibility of using already onboarded operators as part of an oracle system. Similarly, we will also explore the idea of using LDO holders as a resolution mechanism for prediction markets and oracles. To protect operators from being unjustly accused, we will design a mechanism that allows such operators to raise a flag and notify the DAO of the resolution mechanisms wrongdoing. This part will take 8 weeks. TASK 4 Heuristics against Sybils and white-labels. We will analyze the possibility of using heuristic mechanisms to detect Sybils and white labels by analyzing their behavior and setups. We will analyze the available literature on the topic and determine operators and the parameters that should be observed. Finally, we will draft a mechanism that, in conjunction with the arbiter protocol, could be used to detect Sybilling or white-labeling operator.This part will take 4 weeks. TASK 5 Do you trust your white-label? We will investigate a mechanism that will require from parties using white-label operators to trust them with some funds. More precisely, in the mechanism the party joining Lido will need to put some collateral that can be transferred using validators key. Hence, the collateral could be efficiently stolen by the white-labeling party that keeps the key. This part will take 2 weeks. On implementation This phase does not contain implementation. This is since at this stage of research it is impossible to tell what should be implemented, how, and how long would it take. We will propose a proof-of-concept implementation for one of the solutions designed in TASK 4 or 5. We will submit a separate proposal for the implementation effort as soon as possible. This phase will be completed within 22 weeks from the date of the agreement. This phase does not contain any implementation. Organization, Funding, and Budget. The project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 450 000 DAI, of which 200 000 DAI will be paid upfront and the remaining 250 000 DAI on delivery. At the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment.

Fast-track proposals will have a lifecycle of 72 hours due to the nature of the proposal. Abstract. As 1inch DAO further decentralizes, a fast-track process will be necessary to address emergencies. These fast-track proposals will enable the DAO to take immediate action; instead of relying on the standard governance process. 1IP-XX outlines the domains or situations that permit a fast-track proposal and its scope to prevent malicious abuse. Motivation. There will be emergencies where we will need to perform an urgent vote for the sake of the DAO. The existing [Snapshot + Safesnap proposal lifecycle]([link]) takes a minimum of 18 days, which makes rapid responses impossible. Specification. 1. Fast-track process. 2. Scope of the fast-track process. 3. Governance Council. Fast-track Process. 1. Governance Thread for 24 hours. 2. Snapshot Vote for 48 hours. Implementing a fast-track proposal would decrease the time to pass a proposal from 8 days to 3 days. To indicate a fast-track proposal, community members will have to insert \"[Fast-Track] into the title of a proposal i.e., \"[Fast-Track] 1IP-20: Deploy 1INCH on BASE. This is to alert community members about the nature of the proposal. This will also introduce a new tag to the 1inch forum, \"Fast-Track to keep track of all fast-track proposals. ![image]([link]) Scope of the fast-track process. This process can be utilized under the following circumstances. 1. Deploying 1INCH on new networks. 2. Changes to the Governance Process i.e. Adding abstain, raising or decreasing quorum, adding a new gov process. 3. Changes surrounding the 1inch resolver. Whitelisted addresses. Due to the low governance participation in 1inch DAO, introducing a fast-track process can open the DAO to certain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can take advantage of the fast-track process, so we recommend forming a public list of whitelisted addresses that are allowed to propose fast-track proposals. These addresses/individuals will be on the forums. We believe that the following community members should be on the initial whitelist: RoundElephant:[hexadecimals] Natalia: [hexadecimals] StableLab: [hexadecimals] DAOplomats: [Dmat-defi.pod.xyz]([link]) Due to its swift nature, these votes could go unnoticed; therefore, we must have a fast-track whitelist in place to prevent damaging behavior. How to add whitelisted addresses: For a new address to be whitelisted, an already whitelisted address must nominate the new addresses. This nomination would be done in a forum post, and subsequently, go through the 1inch DAO Governance Process, and finally go to a governance vote to determine if the address or addresses should be whitelisted. SnapShot Subspace. To facilitate the fast-track process, 1inch DAO will need to set up a separate snapshot subspace. This is necessary because this snapshot currently does not allow for different lengths for different proposals. The newly created snapshot subspace would have a shorter voting period of 2 days. Implementation. This is how the fast-track proposal would look in practice: 1. Whitelisted member post a fast-track proposal on the 1inch forum with \"[Fast-Track] in the title. 2. Any non-whitelisted members who post a fast-track proposal to Snapshot, will have their proposals taken down. 3. After 24 hours, it will move forward to SnapShot. 4. 1inch token holders will now vote on a proposal via SnapShot. Rationale. Every DAO needs a fast-track proposal process to cater to processes which require timely intervention; 1inchs Governance process would require a large amount of time from discussion to voting duration to cater to an emergency. As the 1inch protocol decentralizes, the community needs this fast-track process to address time-sensitive emergencies.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOI1McJqcvHYT44K8LqZLMmPB64l", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954221, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests implementing a fast-track governance process in the 1inch DAO to address emergencies quickly.

[link] Background. Balancers boosted pools have seen great adoption over the recent year. In order to expand the Boosted Pools product to more protocols in addition to Aave, a Linear Pool registration process needs to be established so that LPs and Swappers can experience great UX during the user flow. One typical example of a boosted pool is the inclusion of a Balancer Pool Token (BPT) in the Form of a Linear Pool. Each Linear Pool is being deployed from the respective ProtocolLinearPoolFactory. One and the same LinearPoolFactory can however be used to create Linear Pools for multiple different protocols, if they are for example forks. During the [creation]([link]) of a Linear Pool, a protocolId parameter needs to be passed. Lets look at some examples. Create a (Aaave protocol) DAI-aDAI Linear Pool - deployed from the AaveLinearPoolFactory - pass 1 as an example protocolId parameter. Create a (Aave protocol) USDC-aUSDC Linear Pool - deployed from the AaveLinearPoolFactory - pass 1 as an example protocolID parameter. Create a (Sturdy protocol) Dai-sDAI Linear Pool - deployed from the AaveLinearPoolFactory - pass 13 as an example protocolId parameter. Create a (Euler protocol) USDC-eUSDC Linear Pool - deployed from the EulerLinearPoolFactory - pass 5 as an example protocolId parameter. Creating a boosted pool is permissionless. Therefore a process to register protocols is required to allow data-consumers to distinguish which pool belongs to which protocol, even if the pool has been created from the same factory. Dependencies. Only authorized accounts can register a protocolId. Orb collective proposes to have this be handled by the Balancer Maxis. In order for this to happen, a Balancer Maxis account needs to be granted the permission to call the function 'registerProtocolId(uint256,string)' and 'renameProtocolId(uint256,string)', which requires a previously granted authorisation. For this an interaction with the [Authoriser]([link]) contract is necessary. Once this has been done, the Balancer Maxis account can call 'registerProtocolId' and 'renameProtocolId ' on a global protocolID registry contract. This contract is deployed on the following networks: |chain|address| |---|---| |mainnet| [hexadecimals] | | polygon | [hexadecimals] | | arbitrum | [hexadecimals] | | optimism | [hexadecimals] | | gnosis | [hexadecimals] | | goerli | [hexadecimals] | The protocolIDs registered by the Balancer Maxis shall be unique. Specification. 1. As per the linked payload, The DAO multisig in each network will initiate transactions with the Authorizer [hexadecimals] and call 'grantRole' providing the address of 'LM Multisig' on a given chain as the account, and the list of the ActionIDs per chain in the table below as roles. 2. Once a new protocolId registration is required, the Balancer Maxis activate the 'LM Multisig' to call registerProtocolId on the ProtocolIdRegistry with a protocolId parameter and name. The protocolId and Name will be determined in collaboration with Orb and the original change requestor. 3. A protocol looking to get its protocolId registered should engage with the Balancer Maxis or Orb Collective to determine what the appropriate protocolId and name to be registered is and action the on-chain change. |deployment|chain|function|role|target|target_address| |---|---|---|---|---|---| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|arbitrum|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)|[hexadecimals]|BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|arbitrum|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|gnosis|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis| [hexadecimals] | | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|gnosis|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis| [hexadecimals] | | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|mainnet|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|mainnet|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|optimism|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|optimism|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|polygon|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|polygon|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|goerli|registerProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| | [20230223-protocol-id-registry]([link])|goerli|renameProtocolId(uint256,string)| [hexadecimals] |BalancerMaxis|[hexadecimals]| Going forward, whenever a protocol seeks to get its protocolId registered, Orb Collective and Balancer Maxis will coordinate with the respective protocol to ensure a proper registration process.

Timeless hopes that by launching LIT, other projects will be able to incentivize their token liquidity at a much higher level of efficiency on Uni v3. Additionally, Timeless use LIT and Bunni to bootstrap liquidity in its own yield token markets. How does Timeless work? Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol. You can provide assets to Timeless (e.g. 100 USDC) and mint PYT and NYT (e.g. 100 PYT and 100 NYT) The assets will be deposited into a farm, and the yield earned can be claimed by the PYT holders. By holding either only PYT or only NYT, you can build either a long position or short position on yield rates such as stETH or aUSDC. How does Bunni work? Bunni is a liquidity engine that was built on top of Uniswap v3. It was initially released in October 2022 as a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Curve and Balancer. These improvements aim to: - Encourage the longevity of the protocol by disincentivizing farming-and-dumping and aligning the interests of liquidity providers and LIT holders. - Provide the protocol with a large treasury to fund growth and reduce LIT price volatility. - Maintain a high level of liquidity for LIT. For more information about the tokenomics, please see FOO: Fungible Ownership Optimization:' [link] Motivation: Timeless is a steadfast advocate of Balancer technology and will maintain its utilization in the long term. By incorporating a veLIT gauge, Balancer highlights the capabilities of the ve8020 model to a wide array of DeFi projects considering their tokenomics strategy. If LIT succeeds in becoming the CRV of Uni v3, both Timeless and Balancer will reap the benefits. This mutually beneficial outcome increases visibility for our respective ecosystems. The potential increase in liquidity, trades, and fees generated by the 80/20 LIT/WETH pool could result in significant revenue for the Balancer protocol and its LPs. Specifications: 1.

Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting ACI and 3SE. Dated: 2023-02-18. --- Summary. This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard UNI to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. The UNI token is the governance token of the Uniswap ecosystem and is a DeFi bluechip. UNI was one of the first governance tokens to be integrated into the Aave ecosystem when it was listed on v1 and was included on Aave v2 when it was launched in December 2020. This ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting. Motivation. Uniswap is a DEX with $4.18B in TVL, second only to Curve Finance with $5.06B, according to Defi Llamas data. Uniswap is deployed on five networks. UNI provides Aave v2 with $15.86m of TVL. Something to note, it is possible with Aave v3 to delegate Aaves UNI reserve holding governance influence to an address which can be used for voting on Uniswap proposals. The risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlets original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations]([link]) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote. The interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don't create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates. We note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback to be incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot. Specification. Ticker: UNI.

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Optimism assets. Motivation. Chaos Labs' Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range. Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here]([link]) You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page]([link]) The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$470,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters. Liquidity and Position Analysis: The TVL in Aave on Optimism (115.5M$) is concentrated primarily on two blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (44%) and Ethereum (30%), with the remaining supply, mostly being WBTC (13%) As we see adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations with minimal slippage on these assets, we recommend increasing the LT and LTV for them and one additional high-liquidity asset (DAI) Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (7%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%) WETH We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. There are a few positions that supply 1-4M$ WETH each and borrow USDC against it; with the chains current liquidity, it is possible to liquidate these positions with slippage far below the liquidation penalty. WBTC and DAI We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations, however, we should call out that around 50% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have proposed an [amendment to the supply cap]([link]) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave. Given the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. USDC We have identified a large position that supplies approximately 75% of USDC on Optimism and does not borrow against its ~$40M USDC position, and therefore does not currently pose a liquidation/bad debt risk to the protocol.

Overnights core product is USD+, a 100% collaterized yield-bearing stablecoin. The collateral of USD+ consists of yield-generating DeFi strategies, including lending to Aave, stable-to-stable and delta-neutral strategies. Motivation: Balancer has clearly been pursuing yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. Overnight Pulse has attracted both strong TVL and stablecoin trading volumes on Beethoven OP. With Overnights expansion to Arbitrum the opportunity presents itself for Balancer to repeat the success of Overnight Pulse on OP on another chain. This is net positive for the protocol. > Explain why this pool needs incentivization. The boost generated by USD+ is attractive enough for the pools TVL to be sustainable.

Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting and @dydymoon. Created: 2023-02-05 (updated) --- Simple Summary. This proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1] Abstract. AIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16] Aave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons. Option 1) Locking veBAL. Option 2) Staking auraBAL. Option 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings. Option 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1) A Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1) Motivation. This BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised. Aave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum: 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1] 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4] 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10] This proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL. Option 1) Locking veBAL. The Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained. In Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL. Whats veBAL ? veBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc Gauge-weight Power Voting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post. Governance Power Voting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate. veBoost Locking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer. Protocol Fees 75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9] veBAL Position Overview. By maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5] With 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12) BAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12. Aave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies: Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools Optimise the yield on treasury strategies Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity Help sustain the Safety Module yield. The boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aaves positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance. There remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6] veBAL yield overview. The veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters: bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR) BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR) The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won't be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold. In the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week. veBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92 Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3% Its important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted. Option 2) Staking auraBAL. Option 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aaves ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position. After the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finances auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8] Depositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield. The yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield. BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance. bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA) AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11] The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped. Growing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings. With 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL. By staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7] Option 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards. Comments. To help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time. !([link]]) Llama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above. There are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal. It is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aaves revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed. Implementation. This section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post. To summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH. |Asset|Amount|Price|Value| | --- | --- | --- | --- | |BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21| |wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05| |B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26| The amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at. Llama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding: 1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH. 2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap. 3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage. ![|307x257]([link]) The BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL. 4. Approve BAL on Cowswap. 5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH. ![|312x312]([link]) Aave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave. At the time of writing there are [14,133,907]([link]) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH. 152,617.9416.65 = $2,541,088.70. $2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56. In performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH. For comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancers veBAL Tool]([link]) The number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time. Future Considerations. The above proposal focuses on whether Aaves preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge. Those considerations are: Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc., [3,4] Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted.

This is done through Messaris Protocol Services, which is separate from Messari Enterprise, the entirety of our work is funded through project grants enabling us to make it all publicly available. Messari Protocol Services believes in the power and importance of transparency and education in DeFi. Protocols enable permissionless networks, and DAOs manage the parameters and designs of the protocol and related token. Both users and members of the DAO benefit from deep data research and communication. Messari PS hires and trains analysts to become a productive member of DAO communities and experts in the protocols they cover, enabling them to help surface key data and events to the largest distribution of crypto users, investors, and builders available. DeFi, and crypto in general, requires unbiased third parties to work with communities to surface transparent, detailed, and digestible information about the protocol and DAO. Messari PS is the leading provider for that solution. For an update from our [prior proposal]([link]), as a company Messari has 3x our headcount with a team of over 150 after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard Digital. We've used that to significantly scale our research, data science, and engineering resources to build out our quarterly reporting and research capabilities. This has enabled us to bring all of our research in-house so we can have dedicated sector-specific analysts assigned to each protocol to cover them each quarter and continue to build up expertise. We have become core subgraph developers for The Graph and are building out open-source data infrastructure that feeds into our quarterly reports and live data dashboards. Lastly, we have been working extensively on growing our distribution and have signed deals to redistribute quarterly reports with Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Refinitiv three of the largest tradfi research platforms in the world. ![[image]]([link]) Existing Work: Quarterly reports [State of Balancer Q1]([link]) [State of Balancer Q2]([link]) [State of Balancer Q3]([link]) [State of Balancer Q4]([link]) Data Analytics and Infrastructure [Subgraphs]([link]) (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon) [Protocol Metrics dashboard]([link]) [Balancer Dune Dashboard]([link]) Governance Messari Governor [coverage]([link]) tracking, summarizing, categorizing over 300 proposals Two long-form proposal summaries related to Balancer DAO and its products: [Governor Note: The veBAL Wars]([link]) [Governor Note: Introducing Staked aTokens]([link]) Other Contributions: First veBAL value statement veBAL unlock schedule Featured pool analyses 3rd party qualitative analysis on major DAO debates and decisions and protocol changes Multiple engagements in the forum Participating in monthly SP calls Participating in Governance Twitter spaces. Note: Everything listed above is freely accessible Proposal Breakdown: Quarterly Reporting. We will produce 4 quarterly reports following the same cadence released shortly after the end of the fiscal quarter. These will break down major KPIs and fundamental metrics such as: Aggregate stats - protocol revenue, veBAL distribution, BL incentives, operating margins Dex metrics - trading volume, liquidity, new pools LP metrics - LP fees, annualized yield. We will look at these from both the macro level and on a more granular level from individual pool level data and network deployments. The data will come from the publicly available subgraphs and Dune dashboards we've built. Data Analytics. We've already released freely available [data dashboards]([link]) showing many of the metrics included in the quarterly reports. We plan to extend this by building an advanced LP analytics page showing: Pool rankings based on. Liquidity, trading volume, revenue, capital efficiency, revenue/$ of TVL Profitability calculator. Pool returns split out by swap fees and reward emissions Backtesting of different LP positions Simulating future returns Help user in finding best pools based on their LP profile. Shortlist pools to LP on based on LP profile and preferences. Track performance of LP positions over time. Compare across different deployments and different pools. Governance Analysis A Bi-Annual Governance Report. Messari will create bi-annual reports to analyze key governance KPIs and metrics and a detailed look into governance structure, process, dynamics, and analysis. (ex: [Optimism]([link])) Details include: Introduction. Balancer Structure and Process Updates. Quantitative Analysis. veBAL Distribution. Power Dynamics (Voter blocs, whales, voter history, etc.) Proposal Analysis (Proposal history, success rate, participation metrics, categorization, etc.) Qualitative Analysis. Governance Design. Structure/Process Analysis. Quorum Analysis. Exploration of governance opportunities. Proposal Analysis. Highlight of contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events. Conclusion Retainer for a Balancer Governor Note. A 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis designed to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals. Key Objectives & Success Metrics: 1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments. Crypto has a glaring lack of sufficient long-form research and analytics. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels to distill information, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of the on-chain activity and important protocol-level developments. This creates a high barrier to making informed decisions as a stakeholder, leading to a misallocation of resources, both time and money, since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal. These services will inform various stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate these stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of Balancer. 2. Growth. Not only are we creating these reports but we're ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messaris channels of 300,000 crypto-natives, which reach most of the active builders and investors in the industry as well as through our distribution through some of the largest traditional research platforms in the world: Bloomberg Terminal: 325,000 users. S&P Global Capital IQ: 12,000 enterprises. Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters): 40,000 enterprises and 400,000 users. This goes a long way to further professionalize Balancer to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity to the protocol. ![[image]]([link]) ![[image]]([link]) A note on success metrics. Given the nature of this proposal, it can be difficult to directly attribute benefits. For example, you can have institutional players consuming reports on Bloomberg and using that as a key part of their diligence to allocate capital however its not possible to say $x of liquidity or investment came in as a result of Messari Research. While we know this is happening anecdotally we can't tangibly measure it. Length of Engagement & Budget: edit: We propose the base quarterlies option for the current cycle: $80k for 1 year. a. 4 Quarterly reports. b. at least one tweet on each quarterly report. c. AMA with the DAO on SP calls about quarterly take-aways and inspo for new analysis. d. Open sourcing our BAL report and model. Payment can be made in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment (in which case there will be a 5% premium to account for additional costs of accepting native tokens) In both cases the funds will go towards: Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. Data Science and Engineering - Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. Distribution - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messaris channels along with the third-party partners.

The [EIP-4824 standard]([link]) defines common interfaces for DAOs via 'daoURI', akin to 'tokenURI' for NFTs. This proposal will upgrade Aave DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar. Rationale. Adopting the EIP-4824 standard will enrich the on-chain information availability of Aave governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the Aave governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, DAOhaus, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of [DAOstar One]([link]) Note that adopting the standard does not require any parameter changes to Aaves existing DAO contracts, nor is there any cost besides gas to call the factory contract. To make the process easier, we have already built and deployed 4824-compliant subgraphs for the component endpoints of 'daoURI', including 'membersURI', 'proposalsURI', and 'activityLogURI' What remains is for Aave to claim these off-chain endpoints via the on-chain process specified by EIP-4824. The proposal does not in any way change the way that Aaves governance works. DAOstar is a public goods project supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Aragon, Radicle, MolochDAO, MetaCartel Ventures, The Graph, and many other members of [DAOstar One]([link]) Governance action. By voting yes, you agree that Aave DAO will (1) upgrade to EIP-4824 by calling the EIP-4824 registration contract located at [hexadecimals], with Joshua Tan of DAOstar/Metagov (thelastjosh.eth) as the temporary manager for the registration contract. No funds will be transferred. By voting no, nothing happens. Technical details. To simplify adoption, we have [pre-built the subgraphs and endpoints]([link]) for Aave DAO. The endpoints can be edited at will by the selected manager, or by another vote of the DAO itself. For example, here is a [live endpoint]([link]) serving 4824-compliant data for Aave. Conclusion. This proposal will upgrade Aave DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar. It is extremely low risk, benefits Aave DAO by upgrading it to the ecosystem standard, and also positions Aave as a leader on standards for the ecosystem.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOI5SqU8SF1jUDN7hT1OMLykcvTa", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954225, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal aims to upgrade the Aave DAO by implementing the EIP-4824 standard, which provides common interfaces for DAOs.

Agave was built by 1Hive to bring Defi to what is now Gnosis Chain for lower fees to participate overall. Gnosis took over xDAI chain and will now be the core token for the network in terms of governance and validation. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether. Motivation: > This Agave boosted pool couples the boosted USD and GNO tokens to facilitate a strong liquidity base on Balancer with Gnosis. By deploying on Gnosis Chain, logically supporting GNO as a trading exemplifies Balancers commitment to the chain. The boosted APR yield to this pool that will persist for users organically and kickstart a flywheel for incentives to drive liquidity depth on Gnosis Chain. By expanding to a new chain, getting boosted pools off the ground first thing sets a precedent for net positive growth for Balancer and LPs on the network. Specifications: 1. Governance: Find more information about MakerDAO governance [here]([link]) USDC and USDT are centralized and don't have governance. Gnosis' forum [here]([link]) 2.

Gnosis Chain is the first chain provisioned by the Maxis in quite a while. In the process of bringing this chain online, we have already passed governance to enable 4 gauges, as well as [granting EmergencyDAO permissions]([link]) As Gnosis was working to move some initial capital into the vaults, they discovered that it was not possible to deposit base assets like USDC into these nested pools.

ARFC: Aave Request for Final Comments (ARFCs) ARC: Aave Request for Comments (ARCs) AIP: Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) TEMP CHECK: Temperature Check. Simple Summary The Aave Governance Process Improvements proposal introduces changes to the current governance process to create a more agile and robust process. Abstract. According to the Aave Governance Process, there is no clear distinction on which kind of proposals govern different aspects of the Aave Protocol. There are ARCs, ARFCs and AIPs that govern all aspects of the Aave Protocol. This proposal aims to streamline the Aave Governance Process by renaming ARCs to become known as TEMP CHECKs and clearly defining the specific kinds of proposals that are TEMP CHECKs and which kinds of proposals will be regarded as ARFCs. Motivation. Due to the lack of a clear distinction between the proposals in Aave Governance, the Aave Governance Process is overwhelmed by proposals which could have shorter proposal timelines because they have been previously discussed and form part of the day-to-day operations of the Aave DAO. This proposal is intended to shorten the lifecycle for mature proposals involving Risk Service Providers' direct involvement while clearly distinguishing which proposals have to pass through the entire Aave Governance Process to enable ample community feedback and participation. Specification. TEMP CHECKs shall become the first step in the Aave Governance Process; if a proposal falls into the scope of a TEMP CHECK as defined below, then the proposal shall start as a TEMP CHECK, and after the TEMP CHECK phase, the proposal shall be submitted as an ARFC before becoming an AIP. However, where a proposal does not fall under the TEMP CHECK scope, the proposal will be regarded as an ARFC and subsequently become an AIP. Amendments. We recommend the renaming of ARCs to become known as TEMP CHECKs. Proposal Distinctions. TEMP CHECKS. Any proposal which falls under the scope outlined below will be known as a TEMP CHECK, and the title of the proposal must contain \"TEMP CHECK. TEMP CHECKs are proposal conversation starters which do not require input from Aave DAO Service Providers. Any discussion which requires general community feedback. Discussing listing of Assets not previously listed in any Aave Market. Any proposal which involves deploying Aave on a new network. Any discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of GHO Facilitator candidates. Any discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of Portals Operator candidates. Any discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of New Service Provider Candidates. ARFCs. These refer to mature and significant technical proposals which require the input of Aave DAO Risk Service Providers. The format of an ARFC must align with the format of an AIP, which will be escalated to Snapshot and subsequently On-Chain Aave Governance. The following proposals fall within the scope of an ARFC: Risk Parameter Changes of currently onboarded assets. A proposal involving the onboarding of an asset which is already onboarded on an Aave Market. Any proposal involving the renewal of a previously engaged Aave Service Provider. NB: It is important to note that the Fast Track 2 & Direct to AIP shortcuts, such as the Caps Update Framework 1, are still valid under this amendment; these shortcuts are designed to enable quick mechanical improvements of the Aave Protocol.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIIp5M8xNfMTjUaQIaZqDLd3kbf", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954238, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Aave Governance Process Improvements proposal aims to make the governance process of Aave Protocol more efficient and clear.

Author: @Llamaxyz and 3SE. Dated: 2023-02-14. --- Summary. The proposal presents Aave the opportunity to extend the Safety Module coverage to include Polygon v3. Abstract. The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilised to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds. A Snapshot vote will determine if Aave extends the coverage of the Safety module to Aave Polygon v3. There is currently $154.80m of TVL deployed on Polygon v3. Motivation. Aave v3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks. Aave v3 has been battle tested for ~11 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance. The authors are supportive of extending coverage of Aave v3 by the safety module in order to offer the Polygon v3 users the same level of coverage as v2 users. Soon, rewards are to be distributed across the v3 deployment encouraging v2 users to migrate. Extend the Safety Module to the v3 deployment further supports the migration of users capital to the v3 deployment. To help facilitate this, BGD has released a migration tool which can be accessed Aave the Aave front end. Specification. If a Short Fall event was to occur, similar to the CRV excess debt event during 2022, an ARC is required to determine how Aave is to respond. If Aave elects to proceed with auctioning funds held in the Safety Module, this will be implemented via an AIP. This proposal is for Aave to agree in principle, via Snapshot, to set a precedent that the Polygon v3 deployment will be supported by the Safety Module if a short fall event were to occur. A successful Snapshot vote which follows the AIP voting criteria will determine if the Safety Module is extended to cover the Polygon v3 market. Copyright.

Gotchi ID: (10504) Securing Protocol Rewards  Operational & funding request. Sigprop summary (important parts): Buyback schedule specifications for buying $GHST protocol rewards outlined in AGIP65. This includes consideration of a non-linear 18-month buying schedule with a 2-month long multiplier for purchase amounts to coincide with the liquidity mining plan, and the funding of an automated smart contract to execute purchases with various features. More details below: INTRO. Per AGIP65 25% of the unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve are supposed to be allocated for securing protocol rewards in the form of rarity farming rewards. To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request. 1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program: The main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO. Filling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases. For voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards. It is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program. 2) Smart Contract. The proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST. This proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production. The expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users: - Gelato automation tooling. - Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery. - Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks. - Toggling for slippage rate tolerance. - Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase. + potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities.

Context. Right now the quorum on Angle Snapshot space is 1000 veANGLE. This means that unnoticed proposals created and voted by addresses with less than 0.01% of the total voting power could pass. On governance proposals created on Angle Snapshot space, usually StakeDAO liquid locker is also voting which means that there should be no issue of quorum whatsoever (as StakeDAO controls 50% of the veANGLE supply) Yet, if StakeDAO was to put a quorum on its space, then there may be situations where StakeDAO is not voting on Angle space and the quorum on Angle space is effective. Proposal. This is a proposal to add a quorum to Angle Snapshot space such that governance votes created on the space are only effective if 10% of the total veANGLE supply at the time at which the vote is created actually votes for the proposal. Implementation. Right now, its not possible to update automatically the quorum based on dynamic values on Snapshot. The way this would be implemented is that the addresses controlling the space would manually and regularly update the quorum to make it match to 10% of the veANGLE supply. Value to the protocol. Having a quorum reduces the risks of having addresses with a very small amount of the total supply taking decisions on behalf of all the other veANGLE holders. This is what happened (on StakeDAO Snapshot space though) for the vote to add a timelock. Only one address with 2m sdANGLE voted on StakeDAO and its vote resulted in 56m veANGLE voting no against the proposal. If there had been a quorum on StakeDAO, the influence of this single address would have smaller relative to its actual weight, and most of all, the vote on Angle Snapshot space would have been given up because of quorum reasons. Here the output of the Timelock vote is mostly that one community member was against, not that there was a majority of the community against it. A quorum on Angle Snapshot space (if coupled with a quorum on StakeDAO space) is a way to ensure that proposals taken by the Angle protocol are considered by a significant portion of the DAO participants, and that no proposals are voted for and or against without the intervention of a big amount of stakeholders. Risks. The main risk with a quorum that is too high is that it may paralyze the state of the protocol, with no proposals being actually implementable. Here the threshold of 10% is chosen so as to limit this risk. Since it implies no off-chain action, quorum decisions could easily be reverted as well. Voting Options. 1. For, increase quorum. 2.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet. Proposal: About Metis. Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum. Andromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereums underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitaliks proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollups security with plasmas scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals. Our second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren't previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change. Third, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference. When combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris' operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder. MetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy. Committed to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways: Builder Mining Rewards. Ecosystem Grants. Genesi DAC Investments The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices) As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aaves multichain expansion. Technical Evaluation by BGD. In the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows: Oracle Infrastructure: Optimal. Blockchain Explorer: Good. Compatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal. Compatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal. RPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable. Custom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal. Support of wallet providers: Good. On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good. Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good. Chain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable. Bridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal. Commitment in security-incidents: Optimal. Network security/technical model: Good RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards. Chain data/indexing solutions: We're currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem. [link] Risk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet. Gauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. [link] Incentivized Adoption. We are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time. Next Steps. Assuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIM99mXi3BIrubrc9ZG0f0psYsI", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954242, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on the Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

Yearn is building yBAL, a new veBAL liquid wrapper (based on our successful yCRV product) designed to tokenize the different benefits of Yearns veBAL position. This system will be comprised of a base token (yBAL) as well as three \"activated yBAL tokens. yBAL can be minted by locking B-80BAL-20WETH into Yearns veBAL position (a permanent one-way \"forever lock) This operation mints yBAL to the user at a 1:1 rate. yBAL carries no yield itself but allows users to enter or exit the yBAL ecosystem. It will be soft-pegged to B-80BAL-20WETH via a Balancer pool. Yearn passes the benefits from its veBAL position to the three activated yBAL tokens: 1. st-yBAL (staking rewards): - st-yBAL will be a yVault that holds yBAL and receives yield from. - 100% of the admin fees from Yearns total veBAL position. - Gauge voting bribes (any yBAL inside st-yBAL earns yield by voting for gauges with bribes) - All profit will be swapped for more yBAL which will be deposited back into the strategy. 2. lp-yBAL (liquidity pool rewards): - lp-yBAL will be a yVault for the B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL Balancer pool. - It will earn yield by auto-compounding BAL emissions and trading fees into more B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL BPTs. 3. vl-yBAL (gauge voting power): - vl-yBAL will be a contract that accepts yBAL and offers holders liquid on-chain veBAL gauge weight voting. - Broader Balancer DAO/gov votes will not be extended to vl-yBAL holders. - vl-yBAL holders receive no yield, only 100% of their respective veBAL gauge voting power.

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Arbitrum assets. Motivation. Chaos Labs' Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range. Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here]([link]) You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this[page]([link]) The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Arbitrum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$510,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.25.49 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.14 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.25 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.36 AM (1)png]([link]) Liquidity and Position Analysis: Generally, the TVL in Aave on Arbitrum (98M$) compared to the overall chain trading volume (~$142M /daily over the past three months) should allow on-chain liquidity sources to absorb liquidations across the Arbitrum positions. ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.50.40 AM (1)png]([link]) ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.51.28 AM (1)png]([link]) Source: [DeFiLlama]([link]) As a result, Aave protocol on Arbitrum is expected to experience very low bad debt, even in extreme market conditions, across most assets. Specifically, the current values of LT and LTV for multiple assets can be safely increased to improve capital efficiency at a very low or no additional bad debt risk due to price volatility. This assumption is backed by simulation sweeps across a large range of values, measuring low Extreme Value-at-Risk (P99 bad debt) value even as LT is increased significantly.

There has long been a desire to see Balancer on Avalanche from many in the community. Over the last few months important projects like making it easier for the UI to support new chains and generalized boosted pool support have been completed which removes previous blockers for Balancer to expand to new chains. In terms of top chains by TVL per Defillama, Avalanche sits between Polygon and Optimism. Its weathered the bear market quite well, and other metrics like volume are also comparable to networks we're already deployed on. Importantly, Aave has a large presence on Avalanche and I believe Aave v3 Boosted Pools would be a very popular new primitive for users and developers. Beyond that, theres a growing market for liquid staked AVAX, in particular sAVAX by Benqi who have signaled an interest in seeing liquidity on Balancer if we were to come. Therefore, Balancer could bring value to Avalanche through its composable liquidity products. When assessing whether a new chain makes sense I think three important factors are: Network size & growth trajectory Balancers competitive advantage (boosted pools & liquid staked tokens) 3rd party incentives. In this case Avalanche is of a similar size to networks we already support and seems at least on par with others in terms of growth/metrics lately. We have a strong partner in Aave for boosted pools and interest from new friends to grow liquid staked AVAX. The DAO has been in early discussions of bootstrapping AVAX incentives but no agreements have been made yet. Another reason I think expansion is a good idea is because of how effective BIP-19 has been in growing Balancers position on networks beyond Ethereum. Before things got derailed with [the issue]([link]) disclosed in January we had gained significant ground on Polygon to nearly become the top DEX by TVL. The imminent launch of Aave v3 boosted pools will be a major growth catalyst in key markets like Arbitrum & Polygon and combined with BIP-19 I'm optimistic on our multi-chain future. Specification. This vote does not have any particular on-chain execution. If approved, the various contributors to Balancer DAO will work towards deploying on Avalanche in the next 2-3 months.

Keywords. Liquidity, sePSP1, sePSP2. Simple Summary. To create an upgrade module from sePSP1 to sePSP2 that does not have the usual 28 day unstake period for the user. To do this, the proposal will request to the DAO a maximum of 10 000 000 PSP per epoch to act as buffer' for this module. Context and Goals. Currently, for a staker to be able to upgrade from sePSP1 to sePSP2 there is a 28 day period in between where they are not part of the staking system with this sePSP. This can be a very detrimental experience for an upgrade which is beneficial for the DAO, as sePSP2 boosts the liquidity of PSP as well as boosting the stake of users. To encourage a better conversion experience for sePSP1 stakers upgrading to sePSP2 , this proposal suggests the introduction of an upgrade module, in which users can deposit additional ETH in combination with sePSP1 to instantly upgrade to sePSP2. Means. In addition to the requirement of a new Upgrade Smart Contract - which would accept sePSP1 + ETH in return for sePSP2 - this proposal is requesting for a buffer' PSP allocation from the DAO. This buffer would allow the user to instantly upgrade without having to go through the unlock period, and in the meantime, the contract can begin the unstaking + withdrawal process for sePSP1. To properly budget this conversion buffer, this proposal will request for a maximum of 10M PSP to be used every epoch as buffer, or about ~ 20% of the total sePSP2 stake. Depending on the amount of sePSP1 being upgraded, this amount can be revised in the future either through a PSP-IP, or with a PSP-EP (as no real funds are being spent overall) Metrics. Proportion of stakers in sePSP1 vs sePSP2. Forward Thinking Considerations. Assuming that the contract is implemented as described here, the only major consideration to be considered is whether this buffer rate has to be adjusted sometime in the future.

Kava Labs: @tommykavalabs. Summary. We believe Kavas co-chain architecture will be highly beneficial to the Uniswap ecosystem. Furthermore, Kavas programs and newly implemented multi-chain Ethereum bridge positions the Kava Network for extraordinary growth in the next coming years. Through this deployment, both Uniswap and Kava can mutually benefit from operating within one anothers ecosystems. We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. About Kava. Kava Chain is a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that implements a co-chain infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of both Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cosmos co-chain is highly scalable and allows Kava to connect to the over 35 chains and over $60B within the Cosmos ecosystem through its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It is optimized for Cosmos SDK developers and incorporates Cosmos' security and speed in Kavas infrastructure. The Ethereum co-chain supports EVM smart contract compatibility that enables Kava to execute the majority of current smart contracts. The Kava translator module allows both of these co-chains to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling developers to develop projects in their choice of execution environment. Kava Labs is the developer team responsible for launching and maintaining Kavas native protocols. These protocols are the following: Kava Mint: Kava Mint is a CDP protocol that allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and receive the Kava native stablecoin USDX. This loan usually has interest rates hovering between 0-5% USDX can be used in the Kava DeFi ecosystem to earn rewards. Kava Lend: Kava Lend is the borrowing and lending platform on Kava where users can supply or borrow tokens accepted by the network. Supply or borrowing tokens gives users the opportunity to earn APY. Kava Swap: Kava Swap is a DEX protocol that allows users to swap tokens accepted by the network. Providing liquidity in these pools gives users the chance to earn extra APY. Kava Earn: Kava Earn is a protocol that allows users to invest in complex DeFi strategies with a simplified supply/withdrawal system. Kavas latest updates are Kava 11 and Kava 12, which both add additional improvements to growth incentives and network security. In terms of growth, Kava is launching Kava Liquid, which will be its first fully convertible staking protocol. Kava Liquid will unlock all staked bKAVA for use in DeFi protocols that operate on the Kava Network. This will be further supported by new protocol Kava Boost which will let users \"supercharge their Kava rewards with bKAVA. In terms of security, the Kava Network is forming the Kava Foundation to enhance network security and aid in critical infrastructure development. The Kava Foundation will determine how to use the Kava community pool to improve critical infrastructure on the network. Proposal. Uniswaps deployment on Kava would be immensely beneficial to the Uniswap Foundation, becoming an early pillar in the core infrastructure of a rapidly growing network. As a proven L1 network with a highly active user-base, the Kava network provides many benefits currently unrealized to the Uniswap network. Below are some critical improvements that Uniswap deployment on Kava would bring: Developer Incentive Programs: In early 2022, Kava launched its Kava Rise program, a $750M on-chain developer incentive program. The program funding model distributes rewards to developers building on Kavas Ethereum co-chain and Cosmos co-chain. The top 100 DeFi protocols on Kava receive pro-rata rewards distributions every month based on user activity on that protocol. Uniswaps deployment on Kava would allow Uniswap projects to acquire a significant amount of this $750M allocation. Becoming active on the Kava Network early in this programs lifespan would enable Uniswap based projects to thrive on this rapidly growing network. Entry into Cosmos Ecosystem: Uniswaps deployment on Kava would also enable access to the Cosmos project ecosystem. Cosmos is one of the most widely utilized execution environments, with Kavas use of its IBC protocol allowing access to the 35+ chains and $60B on the Cosmos ecosystem. Uniswap would gain access to this wide range of users and projects to improve its own ecosystem. Unlocking Liquidity: The recent Kava 11 update launched Kava Liquid, which establishes a foundation for unlocking all staked bKAVA on the network for use in protocols. Converting staked KAVA to bKAVA and supplying bKAVA to new protocols to boost APY improves the performance of all protocols on the Kava network. By deploying Uniswap on Kava, Uniswap protocols can take advantage of these new features to boost their own returns and increase their user activity. Reinforces Ethos: Kava 11 and 12 recently launched new initiatives that encourage Uniswaps ethos of decentralization and security. Kava Liquid allows users to select validators and retain voting power even while staking. This ensures that users are still decentralized and possess their own voting rights. Kava 12 also announced its implementation of Cosmos DAO technology to assist in emission control for the Kava Community Pool. The community pool will be utilized to address critical infrastructure needs as the network continues to scale. Both of these elements support key characteristics of Uniswaps DAO ethos. Security. Given all the discussion and somewhat ambiguity around the bridging solution, we would like to proceed with first a snapshot check on the deployment onto Kava Chain itself, followed by that respective on-chain vote. Then, if this passes, we will have a snapshot vote to finalize what bridging solution will be used. Below, we highlight Axelar bridge, a solution proposed and recommended by the team. However, to be clear, this bridge will be voted on after (if) the deployment vote itself passes and then, incorporating community feedback, a snapshot vote will happen to finalize this. Axelar: Axelar is a decentralized interchain protocol implemented in Byzantine systems like that used in Kava. It contains a dynamic validator set that connects across a diverse set of consensus mechanisms with arbitrary payloads. Some of the core features of Axelar include: A permissionless set of 60 validators based on delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the Cosmos SDK. Security policies for validators like mandatory key rotations and network suspension function in the case of malicious activity. Completion of over 20 audits and bug bounties to ensure the network is at its most secure. Axelar also provides a wide variety of other functions that serve interoperability needs. These include token transfers that allow the sending and retrieving of tokens across chains. It additionally includes general messaging passing that enables any function to be called on EVM chains from within dApps. Axelar also supports gas services that assist in prepaying the estimated cost for any generally messaging passing action. Details for Incentivized Adoption. Upon deployment, Uniswap would be enrolled into the $750M Kava Rise incentive program. This is a TVL based liquidity mining program, where each protocol on the Kava chain receives incentives in proportion to the amount of TVL on the chain. Current reward distribution is 1M Kava/month. The reward distribution amount will also increase as the ecosystem grows, based on governance vote. Rewards are distributed monthly, usually by the second half of the following month. Because of this important deployment, the team is allocating at least $3M over the next 3 years to these Uniswap pools, from the Kava Rise incentive program. We expect the real allocation to be much higher over the year, depending on how much market share Uniswap attracts. As an example, DefiLlama currently reports Uniswap v3 to have $66.94M TVL on Optimism. If Uniswap had the same amount of TVL on Kava, we can do the math: ($66.94M/$305.39M - total Kava TVL) =21.91% of total TVL on Kava. Uniswap would essentially be getting 21.91% of monthly rewards for that month, which is 1M Kava 21.91% = 219,100 Kava that month. These rewards are paid out every single month, and the Kava Rise program is planned to run for several years. A weighted average of TVL reported by DefiLlama is used for calculation of rewards. There are no lock ups for the rewards. Rewards will be administered by the Kava Labs team. License Exemption. We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Kava Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Kava provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Kava by Kava Labs]through the \"Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 21 albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team. Timeline. After passing the initial Snapshot Check to deploy to Kava EVM, we are looking forward to an on-chain vote, and granted that is passed, we will then have a snapshot vote to determine and finalize what bridging solution we will be using. Then we will be ready to deploy Uniswap v3 onto the Kava EVM network.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIM1CMaTWymG3ptL5CZwlICjVQU", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954242, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "FranklinDAO Governance and Kava Labs are proposing to deploy Uniswap v3 on the Kava Network, which is a highly scalable blockchain that connects to various other chains through its Inter Blockchain Communication protocol.

This a proposal to fund Nethermind to design white-labeling resistance mechanism. The delivery will include a detailed discussion of the final design and a systematization of knowledge for white-labeling prevention, oracle systems, prediction markets, and token-curated assets. During the project, a team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is, what solutions are or will be used in practice, and how. Then we will propose concrete mechanisms to make Lidos network white-labeling resistant. The project will be one of the steps toward enabling Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. This is a continuation of[our previous proposal]([link]) The project will take 22 weeks, and its cost  450 000 DAI  will be covered by Lido DAO. Proposer and work mindset. Proposer. Micha\u0142 Zaj\u0105c on behalf of Nethermind. About Nethermind. Nethermind is a team of world-class builders and researchers with expertise across several domains: Ethereum Protocol Engineering, Cryptography Research, Layer-2s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Miner Extractable Value (MEV), Smart Contract Development, Security Auditing, and Formal Verification, among others. Our Research team comprises computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers who work on analyzing, breaking, and designing blockchain and cryptographic schemes. Our expertise and interests span the fields of[zero-knowledge]([link])proofs, non-deterministic programming,[Distributed Validator Technology]([link]), and[decentralized identity]([link]) Working to solve some of the most challenging problems in the blockchain space, we frequently collaborate with renowned companies and DAOs, such as Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Lido Finance, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Flashbots, xDai, Open Zeppelin, Forta Protocol, Energy Web, POA Network and many more. We actively contribute to Ethereum core research and development, EIPs, and network upgrades with the Ethereum Foundation and other client teams. General work mindset. The following principles will drive the development of the protocols: - All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO. - All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols' security will be proven. - Milestones and deliverables will be small to ensure a good overview of the teams progress. Ideal mechanism overview. An ideal mechanism evaluates Lidos DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in[this note]([link])by Lido. Cf. [[link]]([link]) for more details. General objectives. We will assist Lido in creating and maintaining a permissionless and high-quality validator set mechanism. This entails: 1. Designing and implementing methods to ensure that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e., it does not hire a white-label operator), nor is secretly associated with other operators, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly. 2. Conducting a thorough economic analysis to understand how the market fluctuations, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can compromise the systems security. The project will be divided into following phases: - Phase 1:We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. This phase has been completed[already]([link]) - Phase 2:During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to white-labeling-protection. We will focus on arbiter protocols: oracles and prediction markets, to assess they usability in this problem. Then we will propose a mechanism that utilize an arbiter protocol to fight white-labeling. We will also investigate how to disincentivize using white labeling operators. The present proposal focuses solely on this phase. - Phase 2.5:We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the white-labeling prevention mechanism designed in Phase 2. - Phase 3:During this phase we will work on the Sybil resistance. We will prepare a survey on the state-of-the-art approaches and propose a mechanism that significantly increases the cost of creating Sybils. - Phase 3.5We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the Sybil prevention mechanism designed in Phase 3. - Phase 4: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1 to 4. - Phase 5:This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during the previous phases. We will also research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3. Project Objective. Phase 2. White-labeling resistance mechanism design. In this part of the project, we will focus on one of the crucial aspects of the security of a permissionless staking protocol. Namely ensuring that operators perform their duties independently and don't use third parties, so-called white-label operators, to do them on their behalf. An entity that runs multiple operators (whether by controlling Sybils or being a white-label operator) could have too much control over stake, and the protocol in general. This would worsen the overall health of the protocol, weaken its resistance against correlated slashing, and could introduce a single point of failure. We emphasize that even if we ensure that all onboarding operators are honest, we still need to have a system that detects dishonest parties within the set of already onboarded operators. This is because white-label operators can be created among the onboarded operators, even if these operators honestly entered the system. The latter may happen, e.g., when one entity that runs operators buys another that also runs operators. In that case, the buying party may end up controlling too much of the stake. Our work plan for developing the white-labeling resistance will begin by researching several techniques that, we believe, have the potential to lead to a solution in isolation or as part of an amalgam. The different types of methods we will explore are listed below. In particular, we will investigate arbiter protocols. The motivation for using arbiter protocols is following  a party that suspects that some operator is a white label could raise that issue and make a corresponding prediction market where people can bet on whether they believe in the claim. Then the conflict would be resolved by an assigned resolution mechanism. The final goal of our work will be to produce a report explaining exactly how the Lido network can use such methods. TASK 1White-labeling resistance. SoK. We will begin with supplementing the SoK from Phase 1 with an SoK for white-labeling resistance. We will look for such mechanisms used not only in Web3 but also in Web2 and, if necessary, real life. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 2 Arbiter protocols. SoK. We expect some core components to be decentralized oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets (with the focus on the last one) We will use these \"arbiter protocols, as we call them, to assess whether. - a prospective operator will provide good quality services and contribute to the quality of the operators' set or. - an already onboarded operator uses a white-label operator. As a first step, we will prepare an SoK for the following topics: - decentralized oracles. - prediction markets. This part will take 3 weeks. TASK 3 Arbiter protocols. Resolution mechanisms. In this part, we will design a mechanism that resolves disputes in arbiter protocols. We will propose concrete setups for decentralized oracles and prediction markets. We will specify which parties make the oracle and who resolves disputes in prediction markets. We will analyze the feasibility of using already onboarded operators as part of an oracle system. Similarly, we will also explore the idea of using LDO holders as a resolution mechanism for prediction markets and oracles. To protect operators from being unjustly accused, we will design a mechanism that allows such operators to raise a flag and notify the DAO of the resolution mechanisms wrongdoing. This part will take 8 weeks. TASK 4 Heuristics against Sybils and white-labels. We will analyze the possibility of using heuristic mechanisms to detect Sybils and white labels by analyzing their behavior and setups. We will analyze the available literature on the topic and determine operators and the parameters that should be observed. Finally, we will draft a mechanism that, in conjunction with the arbiter protocol, could be used to detect Sybilling or white-labeling operator.This part will take 4 weeks. TASK 5 Do you trust your white-label? We will investigate a mechanism that will require from parties using white-label operators to trust them with some funds. More precisely, in the mechanism the party joining Lido will need to put some collateral that can be transferred using validators key. Hence, the collateral could be efficiently stolen by the white-labeling party that keeps the key. This part will take 2 weeks. On implementation This phase does not contain implementation. This is since at this stage of research it is impossible to tell what should be implemented, how, and how long would it take. We will propose a proof-of-concept implementation for one of the solutions designed in TASK 4 or 5. We will submit a separate proposal for the implementation effort as soon as possible. This phase will be completed within 22 weeks from the date of the agreement. This phase does not contain any implementation. Organization, Funding, and Budget. The project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 450 000 DAI, of which 200 000 DAI will be paid upfront and the remaining 250 000 DAI on delivery. At the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment.

Following OIP-128 and the new budget and compensation structure, designate the Lending AMO project as one of the key focus areas for 2023 and include it in the bonus program. Motivation. OIP-127 outlined the importance of Lending AMOs for Olympus: \"Up to this point most integrations of OHM/gOHM in lending markets have focused on the collateral-side. With the recent changes through RBS and the resulting price stability and low volatility, OHM/gOHM are becoming preferred collateral assets to use - as the recent listings on Silo Finance and Fraxlend have shown. At the same time, it is important for the protocol to also start focusing on the lending-side of the market and to promote OHM as a good borrowable asset as well. There are a few different reasons why. For borrowers it diversifies options to borrow \"stable-ish assets beyond just USD stablecoins. For traders and speculators it provides the option to hedge or short OHM, both of which are not easily doable today. While this may seem like a downside, shorting or hedging allows for more natural market dynamics and price discovery, and helps to prevent unsustainable premiums. For Ohmies lending markets also adds additional utility in that they can lend out OHM to interested parties on various lending platforms. More importantly though - from the protocols perspective - is that lending markets allow for more efficient scaling of OHM as well as diversifying the assets that back circulating OHM. Rather than being exclusively backed by treasury assets, OHM minted into credit markets would be backed by a basket of collateral assets (or rather, a claim on those assets) As a result, the OHM supply could theoretically grow without increasing the treasury assets and/or diluting liquid backing of the floating supply by minting into these lending markets. Finally, Olympus will also be earning OHM-denominated yield on OHM that is lent out, creating a new income stream for the protocol. Project definition. While OIP-127 approved a pilot programme to test out OHM lending markets, these initial tests will be performed through a multisig for ease of deployment. The full Lending AMO project encompasses a more sustainable solution that does not rely on holding funds on a multisig but rather on new smart contracts specifically developed for this purpose. The deployment of a lending AMO smart contract is thus the key deliverable for this project. The full scope of the Lending AMO project is as follows: - List OHM as a borrowable asset on a select group of lending markets. - Implement a warm up period for OHM staking to prevent flashloan attacks. - Develop a set of new smart contracts - consisting of a base level contract and specific implementation contracts for each lending market - that allow for: - Minting into whitelisted lending markets. - Setting a target interest rate and report the total supply needed in that market to achieve this target. - Removing or adding liquidity to manage interest rates (i.e. to ensure rates are close to the target) - Harvesting yield. - Audit these smart contracts before deploying them. Note that while some of these elements listed above are live today already, they were developed during January-February 2023 and so fall within the scope of OIP-128s bonus program. Deadline. The deadline to implement the full Lending AMO project - from the pilot programme to the actual deployment of the audited smart contracts - is the 31st of May. Note: this deadline has been changed in comparison to the original RFC. The main reason being is that the development and deployment of the Liquidity AMO contracts have been prioritized. A separate OIP will follow with more details on this project. Bonus. The bonus allocated for the successful and timely completion of this project is 15% of the total bonus pool.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nProposal. Wormhole is a leading cross-chain interoperability protocol, allowing generic messaging over 22 heterogenous blockchains 1 and soon to be many more. Since launch on mainnet in August 2021, 160 million messages have been transmitted with 2 million messages 1 currently generated a day between asset transfers and messaging. The sheer load of messages that Wormhole processes in a 24 hour period is comparable to an L1 and signals its high reliability. Wormhole has nineteen guardians comprised of the leading PoS validators 1 who jointly attest to messages. Each guardian holds equal weight in governance and consensus. Wormhole requires over two-thirds of the 19 guardians to gain consensus and pass verification, thus we assume that at least one-third of our guardian set is trustworthy. Hashflow is a decentralized exchange platform designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. Hashflow works by connecting professional market makers directly to traders using a request-for-quote (RFQ) model. Hashflow uses DeFi-native RFQs to fetch quotes from market makers who are responsible for managing liquidity in the pools. Market makers are required to cryptographically sign quotes that remain unchanged for the duration of the trade. This ensures that the price is guaranteed and cannot be front-run or sandwich attacked. It also protects traders against slippage if there is significant price movement between the time it takes to validate the transaction on the source chain and relay the payload on to the destination chain. Hashflow leverages Wormholes generalized message-passing to communicate between source and destination chains. We propose a custom protocol utilizing Wormholes generic messaging for cross-chain communication and Hashflows cross-chain DEX to facilitate collateral transfers when backing aTokens (detailed below) Generic messaging unlocks Wormhole as a neutral interoperability layer on which protocols can serve users across most chains today. Wormhole has been integrated with Hashflow, which leverages a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for efficient liquidity provision, depth, and order execution quality. Users request a quote to sell some amount of asset X on the source chain and buy some amount of asset Y on the target chain without incurring slippage on the quoted price. Institutional market makers compete on price and depth for order execution and provide a signed quote to the user, which the user includes as calldata when sending the trade transaction on the source chain. With over $11.75B in lifetime trading volume and aggregate average daily volume of $25M from traders directly using the platform and through the aggregators 1inch Network, Open Ocean, Odos, and Zerion, Hashflow has been battle-tested and is a logical starting choice for these cross-chain collateral transfers. Users pay no trading fees for this cross-chain swap but are responsible for the associated gas fees when bridging their aTokens and might incur an implicit fee in any price-differences between the collateral asset on the source and destination chain. Additionally, Wormhole currently does not charge any fees for token bridging. Pending Aave V3 deployments on the specific L1s/L2s, the protocol can support Aave on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BNB. To start, we suggest piloting Portals on Arbitrum as a burgeoning deployment and ecosystem. Integration. A custom protocol (Protocol) utilizing Wormhole and Hashflow for a Portals integration could function as follows for a given source and target chain: User uses the Protocol front-end built on Wormhole to transfer aTokens to the Protocol contract. Protocol front-end will fetch a signed quote from Hashflow which will be used as a payload to perform the cross-chain swap. Protocol front-end will allow the user to review the quote before confirming the transaction. Users aTokens are then escrowed in the Protocol on the source chain. Following the transfer of aTokens, the source chain Protocol contract calls the withdraw function in the Aave Pool contract on the source chain, which transfers the users previously escrowed aTokens from the Protocol contract to the Aave Pool contract and then transfers the users underlying collateral from the Aave Pool contract to the Protocol contract. The contract then submits the signed quote to Hashflows cross-chain router to swap the users source-chain native collateral to the target-chain native collateral, sending this collateral to the target chain Protocol contract. Next, the target chain Protocol contract calls mintUnbacked 2 function in the target chain Aave Pool contract followed by the backUnbacked function to atomically mint aTokens to the user on the target chain and back these aTokens. To prevent the collateral risk to the Protocol on the source chain and to allow for seamless atomic liquidations on the target chain, we suggest that Aave prevent users from bridging aTokens used as collateral on the source chain and prevent the use of the unbacked aTokens as collateral on the target chain until they've been backed by the bridge. Technical Specifications. Is the entity a Bridge? While users can bridge assets using applications built atop Wormhole, Wormhole is primarily a generic interoperability protocol, enabling users and developers alike to use and build complex, composable applications on top of Wormhole. Can anyone provide liquidity to the protocol? N/A. Is liquidity incentivized? No, at this time liquidity is not incentivized. Is there a fee model for participants? There are currently no fees when participants use Wormhole. Does the entity plan to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol? TBD.

Link to technical documentation. [link] [link] Proposed Portals Asset Minting Caps. On all networks that Aave V3 is deployed on and Wormhole supports, we propose conservative Portals minting caps of $0.5M, $1M, and 50 ETH respectively for USDC, USDT, and ETH to begin with but aim to increase this over time subject to governance. The protocol will charge users a nominal 3bps fee to bridge over their aTokens, of which the Aave DAO will be entitled to 50% Screenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM. Screenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM. 1436168 6.53 KB. Benefits to AaveDAO. Aave is at an inflection point, with a sizable but closing head-start on its multi-chain deployment and usage. With the launch of V3 on Ethereum, it is timely to pilot Portals, enabling seamless flows of capital from the liquidity hub of Ethereum to the other V3 deployments. For AaveDaos longterm success, its imperative that the DAO fosters these multi-chain deployments while still in the lead as the tight integration of aToken assets into DeFi creates a strong moat. Additionally, with tens to hundreds of millions of TVL and volume in Hashflow and Wormhole, we see Portals as an natural way to onboard Hashflow and Wormhole users into the Aave ecosystem.

October 2022 - Quantstamp. October 2022 - Certik. November 2022 - OpenZeppelin. Security Properties. The Wormhole dependency in the implementation above is in the core messaging layer, relying on the standard trust assumption of the PoA consensus with 19 guardians where more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are made up of some of the largest and most reputable staking providers in crypto. This level of operational security diversity is a useful property in preventing wholesale compromise of the Guardian Set due to operational failures of a single or small number of organizations. More information on Wormhole security practices can be found here. Hashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes, and Wormhole for ensuring that the cross-chain messages are correctly passed. The former is a transparent process (the user can see these quotes ahead of execution), whereas the latter falls back on Wormholes security properties. The logic of creating new unbacked aTokens on the target chain, withdrawing collateral on behalf of the user on the source chain, and backing users' unbacked aTokens on the target chain lies in the Aave protocol, falling back on Aaves security. Has the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? On which Networks? We recognize that Wormhole has earned some press for the hack in February of this year. Since then, Wormhole continues to add multiple security layers 1 to help prevent/mitigate the effects of smart contract bugs like the one responsible for that hack: The first of these, Governor, allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. The Governor allows Wormhole Guardians to provide optional value movement protections to token bridges built on Wormhole. This protection allows Wormhole Guardians to govern (or effectively rate-limit) the notional flow of assets from any given token bridge chain. This safety feature allows Guardians to limit the impact of any security issue any given chain may have from affecting other connected chains. The Governor allows the setting of daily limits of notional flow and also has an ability to set a fixed finality delay for transactions over a specific size for each supported chain. Further layers of security to prevent incorrect withdrawals of funds is the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain, which enables Guardians to independently verify if the source chain has sufficient funds to do cross-chain transfers, and an emergency shutdown module, allowing a quorum of Guardians to temporarily pause value movement through Wormhole. Additionally, Wormhole has a $2.5M bounty program on Immunefi.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

I hoped to find 8 members but ended up getting 10 amazing applications from some of the best minds and contributors in the community. These members have different types/sizes of holdings and different political/philosophical viewpoints to represent the diversity of our DAO as closely as possible. We plan to split into vertical teams of 1-3 to work on ideas and come together on weekly public calls to collaborate and provide feedback. This means, as a taskforce, we will constantly be progressing 4-5 ideas in parallel. The projects we intend to start with are: - Kinship Channelling. - @Immaterial. - GLTR emissions/sinks research. - @Maxicrouton. - @Webb. - @Umami. - GLTR Raffles. - @soloegoist. - Guild/District Tokenomics. - @HARDKOR. - @AL. - New Alchemica/GLTR sinks ideation. - @Gotchinomics. - @kuwlness. - Media work (weekly summary videos) - @Nofuturistic. We are asking for funding for 5 hours of work per week at 25 GHST/hour for each of our members on a monthly rolling basis. This will make sure our community members are compensated for this important work and will keep them accountable to ensure that, as a DAO, we are constantly progressing our tokenomics. The total funding for this month will be: 10 members 25 GHST/hour 5 hour/week 4 weeks = 5000 GHST. As we have already started work, the 4 weeks will run from 6th of March until 2nd April.

Background In the last 2 weeks of February Lido protocol experienced an active inflow of several whales, which motivated Node Operators to request staking limit increases. This resulted in Easy Track congestion as most new motions were related to increasing node operator staking limits  since February 27, a day after a huge influx of stake from one whale (200,100 ETH), there were only 16 falling under \"Increase node operator staking limit category, apart from other open categories \"Top up referral partner, \"Top up LDO referral partner, \"Top up LDO TRP. Due to the current limit on the number of concurrent Easy Track motions (12), other actors needed to wait once some motion was completed and enacted to submit theirs. More details can be found [on the Research Forum]([link]) Proposal We propose to increase the limit of active/ongoing Easy Track motions, as under the current settings there could not be more than 12 simultaneous motions. The absolute top the Easy Track contract allows is 24 at the same time (this is hardcoded, and can be changed only via a contract change and redeployment of the whole Easy Track setup, but this is not the issue of this proposal) Based on this and to avoid an unnecessary overburden in the future, when it is unneeded and may impose a loss of potential profit, we propose to increase either by 4 to 16 active concurrent motions, or by 12 to 24 active concurrent motions.

' Summary. Dear Hop Community, I'm Robert from the Partnerships team at Scroll and we're reaching out to propose the deployment of the Hop Bridge on Scroll. Scroll is live on Pre-Alpha Testnet and will launch on Goerli this month, and mainnet in Q3. The aim here is to have Hop be one of our early stage launch partners on Goerli as we view Hop as a highly crucial product for users to bridge their assets across various chains. Goals. We propose for HopProtocol to deploy on Scroll for Goerli launch, and eventually support bridging between Scroll and other chains across the Ethereum ecosystem for Mainnet in Q3 this year. On our side, we aim to support Hops expansion across the hundreds of dApps within our ecosystem as we believe direct dApp<>Bridge integrations will allow for improvements in on-chain user experience. About Scroll. Scroll is an L2 Scaling Solution that is pushing the development of an Ethereum equivalent zkEVM. Our main priorities are to implement a bytecode-level compatible zkEVM with sound zk proofs, work on related initiatives to coordinate the development of layer 1 and zkEVM, and reach a community standard to improve Ethereum for the end game. Security is of highest priority for us and our current EVM implementation is well specified and robust. Our in-house security team also operates in close conjunction with the highest caliber auditors in the industry. Scroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Code security is also closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation, and Filecoin. Today, Scroll is currently live on Pre-Alpha Testnet and contracts can be deployed permissionlessly by anyone and anywhere. We maintain a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is more secure than classical relayer-based bridges. Helpful Links.

[BIP-214]([link]) was approved by governance, but upon review, which occurred after the snapshot, was found to specify the old V4 version of the relayer in both the BIP text and the payloads. The problem resulted the fact that there are many batch relayers with the same contract name. The script used found the most recent address of a given contract by looking through a reverse lookup table in the monorepo that was not up-to-date. The BIP-214 text specified the BalancerRelayer as the target to receive permissions, but did not include details about which deployment was listed. The script that generates these BIPs [has been updated]([link]) to allow for targets to be specified as task/deployment (specified a specific version) and to print that information back out in the tables. The revised script was used to regenerate the BIP output and payloads defined below. Background on the change. A new version of the primary relayer, [BatchRelayer 5.0 deployed by task 20230314-batch-relayer-v5]([link]) Deployment of the fifth BalancerRelayer using BatchRelayerLibrary, for combining multiple operations (swaps, joins, etc.) in a single transaction.

About Hypernative. Hypernative ([link] , [link] [link]) Is a well funded startup, created by top security professionals, which worked and sold companies to companies like IBM, Microsoft, Google, CyberArk and others and has a combined experience of 10s of years in cybersecurity and machine learning/data analytics including team members with vast DeFi and blockchain experience. During the time Hypernative is operational it already managed to warn first many protocols and projects about hacks and exploits before and during they happened (Including Olympus DAO / Bond last incident) and proved the technology can mitigate risks, including some mentions in post mortems and by protocols: [link] [link] [link] [link] [link] [link] The platform is already used today by few L2 chains, protocols and other institutions on security and anomalies detection use cases. Motivation. The overall motivation is to augment security and risk operations and help Olympus DAO team both with our team security and data expertise and with using the Hypernative platform. Its hard to keep track of all various different security risks and exposures in crypto and Web3, having a dedicated team and a real time platform to mitigate and detect these risks for the community, is of first priority in our vision. The result of implementing this offer will be to provide real time detection of any security attack vector on Olympus DAO and its participants and prevent that threat by defining together with the community various preventive workflows. (Leveraging the Hypernative Platform) A security and solidity expert contact in Hypernative which will provide its expertise and help regarding any security incidents, bug/vulnerabilities disclosures or processes. Real time detection and warning the community/DAO of anomalies and risks in governance proposals, bridges, oracles, participants, phishing or scamming campaigns affecting OHM and its holders. (Leveraging the Hypernative Platform) Proposal: A. Protocol Security - Reviewing security framework and response procedure, assigning a contact person for various events. a. Set standard operational procedure (response & contact points) on category of events and time-sensitivity for any security or operational case. b. Understand and create pre-incident measures to mitigate risk and react in time (pause contracts, limit/cap protocol, blacklist addresses, move funds to a safe/vault for emergency etc.) (The selected measures will be voted by the DAO community before implementations) c. Understand and create post-incident measures. Automatically notify Chainalysis to label attacker wallets and track stolen funds. Protocol Security Alerts. a. Leverage Hypernative zero-day detection modules to detect threat and alert in real time on security incidents related to or directed at Olympus DAO contracts. Incident Response. a. Identify root cause(s) and suggest remedies / repairs and communication. Security Operations Augmentation. a.

Detect a lack of updates and staleness. Assist in evaluation of different oracle providers and share historical data. Bridge Security Monitoring. a. Offer: Provide security alerts related to bridge security incidents and risks. Related Token Monitoring. a. Offer: Monitor tokens dependent on or related to Olympus DAO for anomalies, market economic conditions, security, holdings concentration and supply changes (mints / burns) C. Phishing and Scamming Detection - On-chain detection. a. Offer: Detect phishing campaigns targeted at OHM token holders and provide alerts to warn the community. Off-chain detection. (Roadmap item) a. Offer: Detect phishing and scamming campaigns on the web. Detect phishing campaigns on social media (Discord, Telegram, Twitter) and alert related parties. D. On-Chain Governance - Monitor Governance Decisions. a. Offer: Monitor OlympusDAO governance proposals on-chain and apply Hypernative models to detect suspicious proposals. Simulate governance proposals and add relevant automated testing of invariants/conditions for every proposal. Monitor proposers history and risk parameters. Monitor Governance token holders. a.

By increasing Stargate POL, Stargate improves its functionality and reduces the need for emissions. With POL growth, emissions or the need for them, is reduced and eventually eliminated as Stargate no longer needs to \"rent liquidity. For every $1 of added POL, the protocol currently reduces the need for $0.07-0.09 worth of STG emissions per year (7-9%) Of course, POL growth allows Stargate to be a reliable source of cross-chain liquidity for everyone. At this stage, the Stargate LP is not the highest use of liquidity and has a higher effective value if deployed in POL. Historically, the Stargate LP has earned an organic APR of less than 3-4% This is significantly lower than the current 7-9% APR paid for rented liquidity within Stargate. Stargate can save significant emissions (Around 3x emissions saved versus a dollar earned from LP) with the LP stables in Stargate. Stargate is now able to save many hundreds of thousands of dollars in emissions on an annual basis when looking at the data available. At the same time, the need for the DEX liquidity is not as great as it was at inception. Thus a reallocation of POL from LP to Stargate pool should not materially impact STG trading. The current on chain volumes are significantly less than centralized exchange (CEX) volumes, with a majority of the liquidity sitting unused on a daily basis. STG trades overwhelmingly more volume on centralized exchanges versus on-chain historically. When Stargate launched on March 17th, 2022, there were two community auctions, raising a total of $29,960,911 worth of USDC to be added for protocol owned liquidity (POL) liquidity pairs (LP) As of today, Feb 26, 2023 there is a total of $42,716,854.99 worth of USDC within Stargate POL LP (there is a total of over $85 million dollars of total POL including STG within the LP) This accumulation has occurred due to trading fees and price fluctuations. Proposal. By having POL within Stargate pool, the protocol is in a significantly better position. It reduces significantly more emissions than it earns in native yield while helping the protocol rapidly approach zero emissions. With the passing of the recent proposal to hire a market maker for Stargate ([link]), centralized exchange liquidity will become even more robust. As CEX volume makes up a majority of STG volume currently, this will only help the STG market flow freely, complimented by the on-chain POL LP. An ideal adjustment would mean removing $10,000,000 worth of POL from LP into Stargate pools while dramatically reducing the need for STG emissions within Stargate. At current emission rates and prices at time of writing, this would result in a reduction of over $700,000 to $900,000 worth of STG per year. This reduction would drastically increase the path to Stargate being able to turn off all emissions and be fully self-sufficient, owning 100% of the liquidity within the protocol. Execution. Stargate will remove $10,000,000 worth of LP from the various POL LP pairs on Ethereum, adding the equal amount into Stargate pools to support transfer liquidity. Summary. Stargate removes significantly more emissions from the protocol by having liquidity within Stargate instead of LP on-chain. By redirecting $10,000,000 of POL from LP to Stargate pools, this will allow Stargate to dramatically reduce emissions (over $700,000 to $900,000 per year) and strengthen the protocol. This change will result in Stargate saving over three times the rate of yield on the LP in protocol emissions. This still ensures there is robust on-chain liquidity while optimizing Stargate POL for the optimal outcomes.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIc6eASlI6ELNREorbr3tKpAj14", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954258, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that by shifting $10 million worth of liquidity from Stargate's on-chain LP to Stargate pools, the protocol can significantly reduce emissions and become more self-sufficient.

Discord - Burns2854. Grant Proposal. Proposal is to appoint Burns to a compensated position for the initial setup and guidance of the ParaTrooper Contributor structure and ParaSwaps OP funded Grants Program. PSP-IP\u039425 approved the ParaTrooper Contributor structure. This structure requires substantial setup and coordination in order to create a sustainable system. This proposal elects Burns to assist the DAO by setting up initial infrastructure and guide the initial phase. This proposal covers an initial 3 month duration which includes: 1. Champion the ParaTrooper contributor structure. - Setup: defining communication processes, initial onboarding, and setup tooling. Identify and establish other processes as necessary. - Recurring: chair weekly ParaTrooper calls, assist inter-DAO coordination, manage Coordinape circle, conduct monthly contributor temp checks, complete on/offboarding. 2. Setup and manage the DAO budget. - Define ongoing DAO costs and monitor burn rate. Specifically, create budget proposals posted for community vote that ensure the DAO will have a sustainable treasury to operate and grow for 48 months (product market fit generally needs to occur in 2 yrs to avoid burnout but we've seen standard crypto cycle being 4 yrs so it is prudent to ensure sufficient runway for this eventuality) 3. Steward the ParaSwap OP Funded Grants Program. - As part of the approved PSP-IP\u039425 - Deployment of PSP to Optimism 2, a grant selection process was introduced to distribute PSP and OP to further integrations with ParaSwap and Optimism. This is funded through an approved grant from Optimism for 450,000 OP with 50% dedicated to new dApp and app developers that integrate ParaSwap into their swaps and interact directly with the Optimism ecosystem. Engagement for grant applications has been low, stewardship of this grant program would include researching and proposing solutions to improve applicant numbers and suitability for funding. Deliverables: - Develop initial DAO Documentation (Code of Conduct , contributor nomination framework, onboarding/offboarding) - Setup DAO notion page and coordinate with ParaTroopers to maintain (will require subscription funding from a ParaSwap entity) Setup Coordinape circle on behalf of ParaSwap DAO. - Develop and maintain DAO budget in collaboration with the community and associated proposals. - Grants program development. - Monthly report on deliverables progress. Grant Category. Social Escrow Research. Uses that are directly related to improving the experience in Optimism of either the ParaSwap protocol or the DAO. A dedicated, contributor-run DAO can champion the introduction of sePSP2, iterating through the trial period in order to create the best possible implementation of Social Escrow. The ParaTroopers are key to improving the ParaSwap protocol and by extension, the Optimism Ecosystem. Optimism Alignment. ParaSwap is incentivizing growth within the Optimism ecosystem by encouraging integrations and developments within this L2 using grants. The development of a grants program to focus on funding suitable projects is a major component of this proposal with the intended outcome of moving DAO activities towards Optimism. ParaSwap Alignment. Expanding ParaSwap DAO is critical to champion the success and adoption of sePSP2.0. The approved pathway for this is the addition of GovCo and the ParaTroopers which requires the setup of processes/docs and some initial guidance. Amount of OP + PSP requested. Requested funding is: 4,500 USD in OP + 500 USD in PSP per month for 3 months for a total of 13,500 USD in OP + 1,500 USD in PSP with all PSP to be locked in to sePSP2 each month paired with my own ETH, minimizing sell pressure. As seen from these duties, this appointment is a major commitment of time which I estimate at 26-28 hrs per week. The requested funds have been kept moderate to respect the early stage of the ParaSwap DAO.

The Boosted Liquidity Engine (BLE) leverages Olympus' competitive advantages (monetary policy flexibility and treasury strength) to mint OHM into liquidity pools with select high quality assets. LPs bring an asset (e.g., stablecoin, LSD) into newly developed vaults and the Olympus treasury mints OHM in equal value (for 50/50 pools) to match and create a complete LP position. LPs benefit from boosted liquidity mining opportunities and partner protocols are able to more efficiently drive liquidity mining programs and deepen supplemental liquidity for their tokens. Olympus benefits from LPs providing counterasset liquidity, enhancing OHMs liquidity depth, which enables greater utility and stability. Furthermore, the BLE can be a powerful tool for partnerships. BLE is not intended to be utilized for any and all assets but rather select high-quality assets with which an OHM pairing would be beneficial. Project Scope.

A successful community marketplace will: drive traffic to the 1Inch ecosystem and DEX aggregator product, decrease fees to community members by building a 1Inch-native marketplace with rich user experience, leverage 1Inchs brand equity to continually acquire marketshare in the DeFi, NFT, & Web3 ecosystem more broadly. In order to compete, this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2. The 1inch NFT aggregator aims to provide a comprehensive platform for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) The proposed platform seeks to simplify the process of purchasing and managing NFTs by aggregating listings from various popular marketplaces and enabling seamless exchange of NFTs with other cryptocurrencies. The 1inch NFT marketplace aggregator offers users a streamlined experience by allowing them to browse, buy, and sell NFTs from multiple marketplaces in one place. The aggregator also offers advanced search and filtering options to help users find specific NFTs based on criteria such as price, rarity, and creator. Additionally, the platform will provide a unified wallet that allows users to store and manage their NFT collections across multiple marketplaces. Given 1inch networks existing platform, the NFT aggregator will also enables users to exchange their NFTs with other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and ANY other ERC-20 tokens. This allows for more liquidity in the NFT market and provides a pathway for NFT investors to trade their assets in a decentralized and secure manner. For standard marketplace buy and selling, there is no platform fees. Beyond the table stakes expectations of an NFT marketplace and NFT aggregator, as part of this implementation, the 1inch NFT protocol will leverage the 1inch limit order protocol and bring true limit orders to the NFT space. For example, I am a holder of a bored ape yacht club NFT, and the currently floor is 69E. I would like to leave my NFT unlisted to avoid creating additional depth and sell walls, but when the floor reaches a TWAP of 420E, I want my NFT to automatically be listed at any desired price (ex. 2% above a 420E floor) Another example of limit orders, would be you are currently traveling by airplane and unable to get connected to internet and the floor of an NFT I am holding is crashing. Fortunately, on the 1inch NFT aggregator platform, I created a stop loss limit order that would allow me to automatically list my NFT if the TWAP floor hits. Aligned to 1inch limit order protocol and the no platform fees model, for NFT limit orders there is also no fees. Motivation. Based on the current weekly volume data and market share data, it is clear that volume is currently significantly down as compared to the NFT bull run of 2021 and 2022. Additionally, the current farming rewards associated with Blur, have skewed volume and market share. The best example of the effectiveness of aggregators was during the 2021 and 2022 bull run with market share distributed across gem, genie (now Uniswap), and via direct marketplaces (OpenSea) While this can be seen as a challenging market, similar could have been said in the period prior to 1inch network DEX aggregator launch. The value proposition of 1inch network is that 1inch continues to build protocols that can be shared and leveraged across the 1inch network. 1inch is able to bring very large market makers within the 1inch network to act as market makers for NFTs with the limit order capabilities, additional product overlap and connection with the existing 1inch network. This creates a pathway for exceptionally more liquidity to enter the NFT space and drive marker makers to be more decentralized. Specification. The proposed marketplace will have the following features: Limit order creation. 1inch wallet integration (1inch Token) Wallet connect integration Ethereum. Native 1inch nft marketplace. NFT aggregation from (1 inch, openSea, X2Y2, Looksrare,) Buy Now. Bids. Offers. Users can purchase NFTs with any token in one transaction on 1inch marketplace using the wallet of their choosing. Users can search of nfts though set of filters. Users will enter the details such as trait type, floor price, price, rarity, ect. All bids will be made on their respective marketplace and stored inside of the 1inch orderbook. Sellers will be able to accept bids from the users. Utilizing the underlying protocol (1 inch, seaport, X2Y2, ect) transaction will be executed onchain exchanging assets from the maker to the take. Collection search engine displaying pertinent collections to users. Get instant alerts sent to your browser, Telegram, or Discord. Upcoming drops (though application) Add any collection with token address. Suggested Collections. Users will be able to share the collectible with their social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram. Get live floor prices, volume, and sales data on any collection, wallet, or mint. Deep dive into sales history, floor price, volume, and trends. Detailed live and historical charts help you find the perfect entry and exit. Access to metrics such as the moving averages over the last sales, profits and losses, and many other insights. Unique holders and numbers of transactions. Metrics such as assets purchased below current floor, assets never sold since mint, etc. Considerations(Enhancements) Integration with the broader 1inch ecosystem: The 1 inch network is expansive encompassing multiple protocols the close integration of the NFT aggregator and marketplace with services already provided by the network will assist in capturing marketshare. Tight integration with the 1 inch limit order protocol. Orderbook integration with the existing 1 inch aggregation protocol. Markeplace integration inside of the 1inch wallet. 1 inch earn derivatives integration. 1inch api Integration: Expanding the existing automations created for the fundgable token market to NFTs though the integration of the NFT aggregator into the 1inch API product offering. This will allow institutional liquidity players already familiar and trusting of the 1inch APIs an easy entry into this new market. Updates to the indexer: The marketplaces aggregated by the 1inch protocol are perpetually updating their on and off chain systems the orderbook indexer and onchain router will require updates to maintain compatibility. This will be a consistent effort as the marketplace space evolves. Revenue from NFT Marketplace: All the service fees for transactions and listing of the NFT Marketplace during the MVP phase will go to 1inchDAO treasury.

As has been widely discussed on the forum, Aave v3 offers enhanced risk management tools and presents a lower risk environment to users. Here, we propose that v2 aTokens be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury address. From the v3 Treasury address, the tokens can be deposited into Aave v3. Utilisation across the v2 deployment is low and there is excess liquidity within each reserve that enables Aaves aTokens to be redeemed without affecting users. Llama proposes migrating liquidity at the first available opportunity. There is also ongoing and soon to be expanded liquidity mining occurring on the Aave v3 deployment. Consolidate Assets. Similar to a proposal relating to the [Ethereum v2 Collector Contract consolidation]([link]), we suggest swapping all JEUR, SUSHI, GHST + DPI to USDT. The general flow of events is redeeming xSUSHI, GHST and DPI from the v3 Treasury and then swapping the assets for USDT. |Network|Deployment|Ticker|Price|Quantity|USD Value| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolDPI|$70.85|2.29| $ 161.96 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolSUSHI|$1.27|2,055.89| $ 2,610.97 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolJEUR|$1.05|2,622.03| $ 2,753.13 | |Polygon|Aave V3|aPolGHST|$1.04|2,788.45| $ 2,899.98 | |||||Total| $ 8,426.05 | Why USDT, Aave holds more DAI and USDC on Polygon than USDT. If Aave was to deploy liquidity into a 3pool, then more USDT would be required when depositing equal amounts of each asset into the pool. The vlaue of the assets being swapped to USDT is very small relative to exisitng stable coin holdings. Specification. The following assets held within the v2 Collector Contract are to be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury wallet. Using 1inchs Fusion in auto mode perform the following: 1. Redeem aPolGHST, aPOLjEUR, aPolSUSHI and aPolDPI. 2. Approve GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI. 3. Swap all GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI to USDT. 4. Deposit USDT into Aave v3 USDT Reserve.

' Note: Due to the word count limitations, below is a shortened version of the proposal (excl. the review of the past year, the budget explanations and the team info) Full version [available on the forum]([link]) Simple Summary. This proposal asks for 6,000,000 USDC to be allocated to the service provider Nomev Labs, covering the execution of the Services on a consumption basis, for the period of April 2023 to and including February 2024. The requested sum should be paid out of the KYCed 14.75M USDC raised and set aside by CoW DAO in February 2022 for the service provision of the development of the CoW Suite. Overall, this will leave a total of 2,749,876 USDC KYCed funds at CoW DAOs disposal (of which 2.2M currently in use by CoW DAOs Core Treasury Team, cf. passed CIP-19 proposal [here]([link]), 0.5M currently in CoW DAOs Solver Bond and the remaining 49,876 USDC in the [CoW DAOs Daughter Safe]([link])) Motivation. Our continued motivation is to fulfill CoW DAOs vision of a decentralised future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Trades must be securely protected, no matter who the user is. We consider this CIP critical to ensure ongoing development and refinement of the CoW Suite and for keeping a competitive edge within the decentralised exchange ecosystem, including strategic pivots. Service Agreement. Services. - Code development and design based on the roadmap (cf. 1.b); - Continuous improvement of the existing product and user experience; - Executing relevant user research and proposing roadmap adjustments based on its findings; - On behalf of CoW DAO, hosting relevant interfaces, upkeeping and housekeeping of forum.cow.fi; - Assisting the CoWmunity in the promotion of the CoW Suite, including at and for conferences and with promotional materials; - Fostering collaborations and partnerships on behalf of CoW DAO; - Any other assistance and advice that may be provided by the teams expertise, e.g. computer engineering, design as well as relevant project management and accounting services; - Facilitating solver onboarding, vetting and assisting with payouts on behalf of CoW DAO; - Ensuring system security, providing development operations and security personnel. Per need, driving bug bounties for CoW DAOs settlement (incl. via Grants DAO); - Engaging the CoWmunity in the decision making process using the regular governing mechanism; - Engaging with interested parties in outlining a potential next fundraising round on behalf of CoW DAO with alignment on KYC needs (to be decided); - Effective outsourcing to specialists and external parties. Other Services may be included in further CIPs for CoW DAO to decide upon separately (they can but must not lead to additional funding requests, dependent on scope, timing and efforts) Development roadmap. The roadmap is decided by the CoW DAO by means of improvement proposals and forum upon suggestions from any interested contributor. Its the responsibility of CoW DAO and its members to propose and decide the way forward - we want to comply with this ethos: its important to keep this roadmap flexible to adjust to community voices and successful proposals, changing competitive environments as well as improving and changing technological advancements. We propose that the next 3 months will be dedicated to the following items and features: - Customer Order Interaction. - Partially fillable orders. - Automatic indexing of smart contract orders. - Node diversity and trade quality monitoring. - The interfaces features will include other wallet integrations, hard cancellations, bundling Safe transactions, partial fills, improving limit orders experience and significant improvement of the technical code and SDK (software development kit) - Confirming or iterating on a DAO-user focus. - Re-evaluating the effectiveness, transparency and trust-minimization of the CoW governance platform. Features that might follow after the improvements mentioned above are in place: - Adding support for EIP2612 (allowing gasless approvals); - Deployment on selected Layer 2s; - Canonical batches; - Improving the Batch Explorer and adding more information; - Adding more information to the CoW Swap UI (eg user surplus, trading charts etc., subject to user research) Budget.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nBackground The Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via Pendles AMM. ![image]([link]) Section 1 - Issue Statement Stargate liquidity providers can earn STG rewards by allocating their LP tokens to a Stargate farm. Pendle intends to create yield markets for the staked LP positions on Stargate by tokenizing them  splitting the LP token into the yield and principal components  therefore expanding their use case. This is made possible by wrapping the farming position into an [EIP-5115]([link]) SY token that is directly utilizable on Pendle. By creating a yield market, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as: Long assets at a discount Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral A mix of any of the above strategies Any asset deposited into Pendle goes back to Stargates farming TVL. Section 2 - Solution Stargate has protocol owned liquidity (PoL) for the different stablecoins across each of the eight chains it is deployed on, namely Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, and Metis. As Pendle is deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum, it intends to create the first yield markets for Stargate for USDT on those chains. Pendle is requesting that Stargate move $100k each of their USDT PoL on Ethereum and Arbitrum ($200k in total) to bootstrap the Pendle Stargate-USDT yield market pools. Any deposits into these yield markets go back directly to Stargates farming TVL. So the requested USDT PoL would still be owned and fully represented in Stargates overall TVL. In return, Stargate will receive additional incentives in the form of swap fees generated by the Pendle AMM and PENDLE incentives. The Pendle team will also work to promote and co-market with Stargate by onboarding more users into Stargate via Pendles yield markets. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users. Section 3 - Success If successful, this proposal will result in a bootstrapped Stargate-USDT yield market that immediately allows users to trade yield or allowing them to provide liquidity into the pool by zapping in with lower price impact. This will allow Stargates USDT PoL to continue to grow and expand its use to allow the greater DeFi market to trade yield. Through Pendle, this will allow Stargates USDT pool to grow in TVL as well, as any deposits made through Pendle will directly be contributed back to Stargate. When compared to the last previous launches, Pendle has: 1. contributed to 73% of the growth on Gains Networkss gDAI pool since launch (9th Mar 2023); - gDAI liquidity grew by 3.6M LP; Pendle contributed 2.6M LP; 2. contributed to 272% growth in Auras ankrETH-WETH pool since launch (16th Mar 2023); - Aura ankrETH-WETH liquidity grew by 329 LP; Pendle contributed 893 LP; Section 4 - Execution $100k each of USDT PoL from Ethereum and Arbitrum (totaling $200k) will move from the Stargate USDT pool into the Pendle Stargate-USDT pool on both Ethereum and Arbitrum. Stargate will reserve the right to remove the USDT PoL from the Pendle pools at any point in time. Section 5 - Timeline and Costs March 28th, 2023: Stargate team to move $100k of USDT PoL from Stargate into Pendle on Ethereum to bootstrap the Pendle yield market; Stargate team to move $100k of USDT PoL from Stargate into Pendle on Arbitrum to bootstrap the Pendle yield market; March 30th, 2023: Pendle team to announce and launch the Stargate-USDT yield market on Pendle; Section 6 - Summary Pendle will launch a Stargate-USDT yield market on Ethereum and Arbitrum. Pendle is requesting for Stargate to move $100k each of their USDT PoL on Arbitrum and Ethereum ($200k in total) into the Pendle Stargate-USDT yield market. Any deposits made through Pendle go directly back to Stargates TVL. At launch of the yield market, we can expect the DeFi community to be able to purchase USDT at a discount or to trade yield via Pendle. We expect the overall USDT TVL on Stargate to increase by at least 20% once this yield market is live.

Cadence for community OIP and review to move from 3 month cycle to when additional funding would be requested.

Its been one year since the Olympus community approved the creation of the Grants Program in OIP-55 (forum, snapshot) OIP-55 stipulated that the grant program be run for a trial period of 3.3 months. The program was then renewed by community governance as part of OIP-90 (forum, snapshot) and OIP-108 (forum, snapshot) The Grants Program aimed to benefit Olympus and OHM by helping to support aligned protocols that drive OHMs core mission of becoming Web3s reserve currency and supporting key Olympus12 goals. At this time it is the recommendation of the Grants Working Group that merging efforts with the Partnerships team would be the most effective use of resources to achieve further adoption of OHM use as a Unit of Account and expand OHMs utility throughout DeFi. The high level success came from internal referrals, so reducing the current time spent on intake given the macro environment is the recommended course of action. Grantee Achievement Highlights. Here are a few highlights Grants has enabled within the econOHMy since our public launch on 14th February 2022: Total of 37,536.5 OHM (worth 629,447 USD at time of sending, current value of 375,365 USD) awarded across 20 grants. High level successes: Education. Artemis. Of 17 students trained, 2 have built on OHM with a total of 13 capstone projects done in the two bootcamps, from which 6 are being developed as real products to deploy on mainnet. Olympus Scholars Program. Asfi of WAGMI Labs says: \"Our goal was to make interactive educational content that delivers comprehensible input in a low anxiety environment. A grant from Olympus helped us deliver on that and community feedback (big shout out to Relwyn) helped us improve our prototype a lot. We have signed on two more customers since then. Thank you Ohmies! Utility. MoverDAO. A non-custodial debit card that allows you to spend gOHM via MoverDAO (yes you are reading that correctly - now known as HolyHeld) On the way to delivering an Olympus mobile payments App (think OHM Venmo) Majin never needing to leave OHM! Infra. Playgrounds. Empowering users with on-chain data analytics tools which will help drive utility and adoption for Onchain Governance. Built data and metrics interface for Olympus Pro (now Bond Protocol) heres a quote from Edgecaser, the Data and Metrics lead, \"We contracted the PG Subgrounds team to build a data feed for Olympus Pro bond performance, which needed to be built in as short a time as possible. Their team showed utmost professionalism, discipline, and talent in their craft. They delivered on time and to spec; with impeccable documentation. I look forward to working with them again. And then Edgecaser again from a more recent collab: \"Playgrounds helped the Olympus Data and Metrics group monitor bond releases on day 1 with 5 minutes of setup. Their team made sure everything was up to snuff and problem-free. I would happily work with them again anytime. OHM-EPNS integration.

According to the EPNS documentation: \"EPNS is a notifications protocol which enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets) EPNS will be immediately beneficial to the Olympus ecosystem, especially as we move towards on-chain governance. Ensuring a tight link between Grants activities and Olympus12 priorities. The Grants program has had requests for more than $13mm in funding across 100 unique applications. Over the last quarter 5 additional applicants have been identified as being within remit of current priorities of the protocol. These are: . Olympus Scholars Program by Asfi of WAGMI Labs ($30,000) 20 active students. Check lectures here: [link] Content is here: [link] . Investigating the Interaction between MEV Bots and Olympus POL ($5,000) Research document into MEV Bots impact on Olympus POL with research conclusions which can inform Policy. . Elastic Finance DAO ($25,000) Utilities include integrating OHM into the Elastic Vault and pairing the vaults reward token EEFI with OHM, and engaging in other product development activities. . TripsTrade ($25,000) Building an open source payments SDK which will allow merchants to accept OHM as payment and keep it as OHM. Also integrating OHM as a payment method on the TT site. . Asphodel ($25,000) Building an economic controller system needed for proper integration of external tokens with their game smart-contracts. This would be turned into an open source SDK allowing other games to easily utilise OHM. Budget to date. Since launching in early December 2021 the Grants program has been operating during an ongoing down trend in the markets. As such the USD value of OHM granted to the program via OIPs 55, 90 and 108 has seen a significant decrease in value requiring various difficult negotiations and compromises to manage these facts. Grants supported. Total of 629,447 USD of OHM awarded over the lifespan of the Grants Program. On December 6th the community granted $1.5mm via OIP-50 (OGPv1) of which 164,083.48 USD was distributed. The remaining $1,335,916.52 worth of OHM remained in the DAO multisig. OGPv1 committed to a total of $824,999.00 USD across 13 grantees. On April 10th the community granted $1mm via OIP-90 which would cover the remaining $660,915.52 USD of obligations, new grants and operating costs for the program. Over this period there was a further 50% drop in the market price of $OHM. Due to these adverse market conditions the figure of $660,915.52 was negotiated down to a total of $271,363.61 which was paid out at a rate of $32USD per $OHM (the operating rate set by OIP-90) for grantees carrying over from OGPv1. This had the effect of a reduction in the USD value of the grants. On August 21st the community granted $333,000 USD via OIP-108. With Artemis ($50k) and OHM-EPNS ($9k), Olympus Scholars ($30k), MEV Olympus POL Research ($5k), Elastic Finance DAO ($25k), TripsTrade ($25k) and Asphodel ($25k) grants, this puts remaining funds available to the program at ~200 gOHM (~$500k) Legals and Governance. Given the launch of the Olympus Association (OIP-124 snapshot), it is proposed to transfer the remaining grants funds and contributor compensation budget to the Association. Summary. Do not add additional funds to the Grants Program at this time. Cadence for community OIP and review to move from 3 month cycle to when additional funding would be requested.

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative. Date: 2023-03-17. Simple Summary This Temperature Check proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. Background Aave V1 has been frozen since December 2022, and users have been given ample time to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1. Motivation Aave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem. Specification The offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1. New Rate Strategies For each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented: 1. uOptimal: 20% 2. reserveFactor: 99.9% 3. base rate: 3% 4. slope 1: 7% 5. slope 2: 200% These changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms. Next Steps 1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal. 2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal. 3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

Pool deployed [here]([link]) Gauge deployed [here]([link]) References/Useful links: Website: [link] Documentation:[link] Transparency: [link] Github Page: [InverseFinance]([link]) Communities: [Discord]([link]) Defillama: [DOLA: TVL and stats]([link]) Protocol Description: Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community. Inverse DAOs core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation; On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finances \"Fed contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans. Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $56M TVL), or the DOLA-FRAX basepool through our partnership with Frax. Via purcha stablecose with DAIin using[The Stabilizer]([link]) DOLA is not \"algorithmic\" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA. Motivation: This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/bb-f-usd 50/50 stable pool. Inverse recently successfully obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA]([link]) 50-50 pool on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Platform BAL incentives would help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. The [DOLA-3CRV]([link]) gauge on Curve currently has over $56MTVL ($108M ATH) and Inverse recently obtained gauge approval for a [DOLA-FraxBP]([link]); we have provided around $1mm USD value in bribe incentives to drive liquidity into these pool. If approved, we expect to do the same for our veBAL gauge and are in coordination with Hidden Hand to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative. The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartels Hidden Hand (\"HH) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the 50/50 DOLA/bb-f-usd stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer. Specifications: You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs]([link]), [governance]([link]) and our [transparency]([link]) pages. Governance: Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the [DOLA-3CRV]([link]) and [DOLA-FraxBP]([link]) Curve pools as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here]([link]) Equally, check out our transparency portal [here]([link]) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance. Oracles: A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[incident on April 2nd]([link]) This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverses Risk team. Inverse Finances new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finances old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable. Audits: Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with [Peckshield]([link]), and boutique security firm [Defimoon]([link]) A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here]([link])), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the teams formation can be found [here]([link]) Centralization vectors: Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are: Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management. Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market. Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers. Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts. Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here]([link]) DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so. Market History: Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the \"Feds, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLAs Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. We now expect to have further resilience through the deepening of our [DOLA-FraxBP]([link]) and our [INV-DOLA]([link]) bal LP.

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-03-02. - -- Summary ZkEVM is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup L2 developed by the Polygon team that is expected to be deployed on March 27th. Aave V3 has been successfully deployed on the ZkEVM testnet for approximately 6 months (since October 2022) This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team. Since ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. The Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform. This minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (MVP V3), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk. This ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network. Abstract This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to \"temp check the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2. Motivation The proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021. ZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure. It is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them. This proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future. Overall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aaves reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks. Specification This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an \"MVP V3 of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC. | Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | | Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES | | Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | | Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO | | Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | | Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% | | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% | | Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% | | Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% | | Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | | Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 | | Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 | | Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | | Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | | Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% | | Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% | | Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% | Disclaimer.

Context & Goal After a first grant proposal draft, the PSP-IP\u039426: ParaSwap Monthly Financial Reporting vote awarded a monthly PSP grant of $1000 to Asymmetric Defi to run a monthly report. The reception of the first report 2 and the various feedbacks from the community question the quality and relevance of the work provided. After discussion with @adalhi (Asymmetric Defi contact), the latter goes along in the direction of putting an end to the proposed service. Despite the deletion of the document by its author, and his wish not to be paid for the report produced, this proposal aims to thank the author for their interest in the DAO and the time spent in trying to produce this report. To do this, this proposal aims for a partial compensation relative for the time spent on this, despite the final report not meeting the goals set by the proposal itself, mainly to: \"Inform the community about the financial state of the DAO and the impact of governance votes, crypto trends & news on the protocols performance. Includes Market share analysis\" Indeed, although briefly mentioned, there is no analysis done between the governance votes, the protocol announcements, the global crypto market and the numbers exposed. In addition to the lack of these proposed sections, there were many reported numbers that have been found to be erroneous on several occasions (such as the presence of liquidity mining programmes, wrong Protocol Revenues, etc) not allowing this document to have its role of informing and educating the members of the DAO. If anything, this outdated information could lead to potential readers being mislead with factually erroneous asssesments. Market share planned is not present. This proposal aims to revoke the grant in an anticipated way and to pay a one-time allowance of $300 in $PSP. This one time allowance will be conditioned to the positive return of the grantee. The latter having left the discord without warning. This return will have to be done before March 31, 2023. Means The proposal, if passed, will require the payment by the DAO of $300 in PSP to the Asymmetric Defi wallet (after they validate the will of this payment before March 31, 2023): [hexadecimals], which was posted by @adalhi on the 2 January 2023 in the proposal. The proposal will mark the end of the grant and Asymmetric Defi will be informed of the vote through one of the communication channels previously used (governance forum, discord) The vote will confirm their previously stated commitment to end the partnership.

Beefy has many strong traits, two of the most outstanding ones are a big focus on security, and great user experience. User experience wise, we are constantly improving our contracts, design, and application, to make DeFi available for everyone. This can be seen in our app, which loads info from +600 vaults with efficient RPC calls, and displays everything without focusing on which chain you are connected to, giving our users a see-through view of all DeFi opportunities, allowing them to choose the best yields. We just integrated 1inch in the back, so you can enter any vault, with any token with 2 transactions (1 approval and 1 contract call) This is a huge leap in user experience, since in the past, you would need up to 7 transactions, and jump between different protocols, making the DeFi experience overwhelming and cumbersome. Issue Statement: There are still things to improve in the DeFi experience. The biggest one is moving value across different blockchains. Getting the correct tokens, the right amounts, and finding an appropriate bridge can still be a daunting experience for some inexperienced users. Its also worth noting that you have to pay transaction fees for all of this. Solution: Now, we are making another leap in terms of UX, making the cross-chain experience even easier thanks to technologies developed by Stargate that haven't been available in the past. Stargate technologies are empowering the Beefy engineering team to create a truly cross-chain seamless experience. Allowing users to enter and exit vaults without leaving the app, without the need to know how to use DEXes, bridges, get gas on the destination chain, etc. We want to incorporate into our solution, a reward-system that compensates the gas paid for bridging in and out of Optimism. Bridging through Stargate currently costs 6bps of the transaction. We would develop a smart-contract that reimburses those 6bps back to the user in OP tokens. This would motivate users to use this newly implemented solution, bringing more TVL to Beefy, more volume to Stargate bridges, and overall more adoption to the Optimism ecosystem. Since Beefy is completely open-source we are sure this functionality (like many before) will be replicated by other protocols, making Stargate the de-facto bridge to transfer tokens seamlessly between chains, without leaving said dApp. We are requesting 75,000 OP tokens. 80% will be used to periodically fund the contract that reimburses the bridge costs, and the remaining 20% will be used for marketing and promotions around the launch of this revolutionary feature. Success: We aim to distribute the whole amount in a course of 12 months, bringing around $40M of bridged volume to Stargate. If we manage to capture that amount we will call the initiative a success. Execution: The Beefy team will create a new section in our app, where users will see all of their stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) and ETH no matter what chain they are connected to, and they will be able to choose to which of the vault they wanna deposit in (from the 8 chains Stargate and Beefy share) So if you are connected to Polygon, and wanna zap+deposit the stablecoins that you have in Arbitrum into the wstETH-ETH vault on Optimism, the app will prompt you to change the network, and do 2 transactions (approval and contract interaction) The app and contracts in the back will take care of bridging your stablecoins, trading them on the most efficient routes through 1inch to get wstETH and ETH, provide liquidity, and deposit the LP tokens in your behalf, also you will be reimbursed of the 6BPS that Stargate charges you (discounted from your initial stablecoins) in OP. Withdrawing from vaults will also be possible with this feature. You will see the Beefy vaults where you have deposits (limited to the 8 shared chains), and will be able to exit your position and bridge with just 2 transactions. (and get reimbursed for the bridge fees) In the future we will extend the future so you can start the flow with any token, and our Zap will take care of getting the USDC/USDT/DAI/ETH to bridge (and the same for withdrawal) Timeline and costs: Our team is working hard to have the most complete and easy to use DeFi app in the space. For this we need to keep adding features in a way that respects our design, and does not collide with other characteristics of our app. We also need to restructure our API to support this feature, deploy new contracts, and test exhaustively the feature to make sure our users have the same amazing experience as always using Beefy. We are aiming to have all of these tasks completed by Q3 2023. There will be no extra costs that need to be considered in this proposal. Summary: Beefy will develop a new feature to enter and exit vaults no matter what chain you are connected to. To promote the adoption of the feature we will incentivize users reimbursing the Stargate fees with OP tokens. We will leverage our socials and partners to bring excitement to the feature. Tokens will be distributed in a period of 12 months, features will be live in Q3 2023 and we expect to bring around $40M of Volume.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIuabHtV1DsKGCY01kLdHhuCZBO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954276, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Beefy, a multi-chain yield optimizer, is proposing to enhance the DeFi experience by making cross-chain transactions easier.

As these refunds are done in PSP, three main limits were set during the initial proposal and budget allocation, as well as the later adjustment and renewals in the PSP 2.0 proposal: - A per-address limit of USD 2500 per epoch. - A per-address yearly maximum of USD 30k. - A global budget limit of 30M PSP. Until now, these limits have been enough to maintain the program sustainable. However, a new surge of activity driven by a small number of wallets shortly after PSP 2.0 has put pressure on the current budget in a way that threatens the exhaustion of the budget well before the end of the year. While most of this volume comes from a healthy level of protocol growth (such as the doubling of eligible stakers that are part of the GRP), one worrying figure concerns the top eligible claimants of the GRP compared to previous epochs. In summary, for the first PSP 2.0 epoch, the Gas Refund Program distributed 3.07M PSP, more than 10% of the total global budget. Less than 7% of all refunded wallets got 83% of the total PSP refunded, despite only generating 8.8% of the epochs volume. Were this behavior to continue during the second epoch, over 20% of the total global Gas Refund budget could be drained, with +80% of it going to these small number of wallets. ![[image]]([link]) To ensure the sustainability of the Gas Refund Program, this proposal aims to amend the current limits to a new level that will keep the budget sustainable while not affecting the vast majority of users. One way to ensure the sustainability of the program is to reduce the viability of the program for users who do not have a long-term outlook for PSP. To do this and to further promote the engagement of gas refunded addresses with PSP 2.0 and the social escrow system, a potential solution is the distribution of sePSP1 instead of PSP. This saves the staking gas costs for users with a long-term outlook for PSP and also makes the claimable sePSP1 be considered as part of the user ParaBoostScore without the need to claim. In addition, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Gas Refund Program, this proposal aims to amend the current limits to a new level that will keep the budget sustainable while not affecting the vast majority of users. Goals, Means, and Implementation Due to the time-sensitive nature of these measures, the proposal proposes the following changes to be implemented to the gas refund program before the end of Epoch 2 and applicable to it: - Reduce the maximum per-wallet limit to $500 per epoch. - Replace the distribution token from PSP to sePSP1 only on Ethereum Metrics The success of this proposal can be measured by whether Epoch 2s PSP Emissions adhere to the expected budget projections for the year or not and have a fair distribution of the total amount of PSP distributed in the epoch. Forward-thinking considerations While this new per-epoch limit might be sufficient to mitigate the current emissions, it could be adjusted again if the average network gas emissions rise throughout the network. Additionally, in the future, the DAO could consider additional measures to limit the opportunistic nature of Gas Refunds.

As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward. To continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact. ACIs current & future areas of focus 1. Governance and AIP Development - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes. - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs. - Engaging with the community on forum discussions. - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders. 2. Treasury Efficiency and Management - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management. - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors. - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation. - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users. 3. Protocol and Ecosystem Development - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs. - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis) - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral. - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for \"Real Yield revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO. - Support the expansion of Aave markets in \"new Frontiers networks. 4. Research and Analysis - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments. - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community. - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions. - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques. 5. Team Expansion and Operations - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better. - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure. - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement. - Start a \"Meta-Governance focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered \"Aave-Maximalist, theres a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other \"professional delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem. 6. Independence & Transparency - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power. - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol. - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely. - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO. Previous Work Here are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative: - Governance Coordination: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly ZERO AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022. - AIPs: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave. - Governance improvement: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible. - Delegators & contributor coordination: The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous \"co-authorship synergies with other DAO actors. Requested Budget We are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us: - Sustainably continue our current work. - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work. - Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the \"One-Man Army meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation. - Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem. By securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem. Next Steps If the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposals specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal. We commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress. Thank you for considering our proposal.

GotchiID: 10138. Dear fren, I'm Mialalala, a longstanding participant of the Aavegotchi community especially in Asian market. I am writing to express my delight at the recent developments within the community, particularly with the unveiling of the 2023 roadmap, which has ushered in a new era of vibrancy and growth. However, with the increase in community members and the decentralization of the entity, which will increase the complication of the operation and disclosure, I believe that it is now necessary to establish a DAO steward role to manage / disclose the treasury balance changes and governance data regularly. This will not only ensure transparency and accountability in the governance of the community but also provide a clear and concise entry point for new members to understand the DAO structure, including the treasury and governance. Therefore, I propose that we consider the creation of a DAO steward role, which will be responsible for overseeing the management of the treasury and promoting good governance practices within the community. This will enable us to build a more robust and sustainable Aavegotchi ecosystem that is better equipped to meet the needs of our growing community. What're the responsibilities of the DAO steward team? The DAO Steward Team will be responsible for the following: 1- Building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile/Dashboard. Aggregating basic information and social graphs, and converting them into a DAO profile. Mapping the treasury addresses of the DAO and its associated parties, including sub-DAOs or DAO departments. Analyzing the evaluation of the treasury assets, including fungible tokens (FT) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) Tracking the inflow and outflow of assets. Aggregating governance data, including proposals, voters, votes, and more. Tracking the approved proposals and keeping a record of fund consumption. 2- Generating Monthly Treasury Report. The status-quo of the treasury assets including FT and NFTs (balance sheet) Monthly assets inflow and outflow. The Status-quo of governance (data about proposals/voters/votes; Approved proposals and rejected) Follow-up and feedbacks about the old approved proposals. Publishing and sharing the report in Aavegotchi discord monthly. As one of the early members of Aavegotchi, we hope to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. We are thrilled to see so many active DAO adopters and players in the community already. We believe that more and more fresh blood will contribute to DAO, and that such a community will become more and more dynamic and creative. We hope that our contributions and plans, along with our request for a one-time grant of 7200 DAI and a monthly reward of 2500 DAI, will be considered. Grant can be issued all at once, while the monthly rewards can be released each month. To better test and verify our work, we propose a trial period of 6 months for the DAO Steward role. Our Team Structure: We will apply for this position through the entity team called ThePASS, which is a senior team focused on DAO treasury and governance asset exploration and research. We will allocate the following personnel and roles: | Mialalala | Project Manager | Responsible for the DAO steward team | | Muneeb | FrontEnd | | Yung | BackEnd | | Lim | UI/UX Designer | Responsible for dashboard design and future report design | | Hakan | Content Writing | Responsible for drafting and polishing reports or other content | | Fengyun | Technology Content Writing | Responsible for talking with the DAO and team from tech side | | Di Kim | Data Engineering | Responsible for tracking the related data both about the treasury and governance | | Nina L / Saya Lin | Content Publishing / Socials | Responsible for the monthly report publishing and sharing| To sum-up, I propose the establishment of a DAO steward role within the Aavegotchi community to manage the treasury balance changes regularly. This will promote good governance practices within the community and ensure transparency and accountability. As we continue to attract more participants, a DAO steward team will be responsible for building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile/Dashboard and generating a monthly treasury report. We are excited to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. With more fresh blood joining the community, we believe that the Aavegotchi ecosystem will become more dynamic and creative. Lets work together to build a robust and sustainable community. More information. The PASS is a DAO aggregator and treasury tracking platform. It helps build the reputation system for DAOs by aggregating the social graph (onchain+offchain) and track, analyze, and evaluate treasury assets including FT and NFT assets, giving the communities a better and more transparent way to dive deeper.

Category. Service Agreements - Decentralized Gnosis Chain Public RPCs powered by Pocket Network. Executive Summary. Pocket Network is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the RPC layer. Its goal is to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving, multi-chain gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers to mint reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported, including both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival. For example, over the last month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 3 spot in terms of requests per day at ~130.6M daily average requests through Pocket Network according to POKTscan! After speaking with stakeholders on both sides of the aisle, Pocket Network Inc has been encouraged to publish this new Gnosis Improvement Proposal without the retroactive funding aspect. The previous years of service are a gift to the Gnosis community of users, developers, applications, and protocols. Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate Pocket Networks value proposition as the most redundant, reliable, multi-chain RPC layer by taking on additional traffic during Dark Forest rounds and the xDAI to Gnosis Chain transition (to name a few past examples) Gnosis and Pocket stakeholders favor an 18-month service contract to fund continued access to decentralized RPC alternatives for both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival. It will allow GnosisDAO to steward this public good together with Pocket Network! By funding a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, GnosisDAO and Pocket Network would continue to contribute to the decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All the while, continuing to incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens for serving Gnosis dapps. Service Description. Pocket Network Inc. staked POKT on behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsidize a public good in the form of public RPC endpoints (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits: 1. [link] 2. [link] The current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) Pocket Network supports are: 1. Gnosis Chain pruned = 0027 (mainnet) 2. Gnosis Chain archival = 000C (mainnet) The POKTdao allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07/06/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival (000C) shortly after on 08/26/21) Since the allowlist date, Pocket node operators earned 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read/write requests. See this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned. Over that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated, stable, and higher-performant pools of nodes. Pockets network of node runners easily handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day recently in JAN 2023. Over the last year or so, Pocket Network has been serving 100M+ requests per day with an excellent average response time of ~150ms with success rates above 99% across all Pocket Portal regions. Moreso, in the Asia-Pacific region (most used region by Gnosis) the response times are as low as 40ms (lower = better & faster) ![gip83 [image]]([link]) According to POKTscan, there are currently 20,596 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,695 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain ID. This demonstrates the POKT node incentives at work! The POKTdao has also supported node deployment solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode to make it super easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full/archival nodes within the Pocket Network protocol. Service Scope and Service Delivery. Pocket Network agrees to these milestones and deliverables: ![gip83 milestones and deliverables.PNG]([link]) Support. The GnosisDAO will be able to monitor and manage the public RPCs through our Pocket Portal as they see fit, including the ability to enable additional security features such as allowlisting user-agents, origins, smart contracts, and methods. ![gip83 portal security [image]]([link]) The GnosisDAO and Gnosis Chain users are able to submit support tickets through this link. Pricing and Payment. Pocket Network has simplified their model this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more affordable. To sweeten the deal, Pocket is offering the Gnosis DAO team and community a massive discount on a 150M requests per day at $0.0000020 throughput an 18-month commitment with the option to renew: $164,250 USD for 150M Requests Per Day on a 18-month contract. That represents 3.65x in yearly savings (a 365% discount) compared to the original offer! Payment Schedule. Payment Dates Amount Due. Upon Proposal Passing (50%) = $82,125 USD. Upon Milestone Completion (50%) = $82,125 USD. Total (100%) = $164,250 USD. PNI prefers payment in stablecoins, such as USDC or DAI, at this provided address from Pocket Network, Inc.  [hexadecimals] In case a buffer is wanted/needed, as traffic continues to grow, PNI would like to extend another option to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price of $0.0000018640 per request throughout the contract period. If Pocket Network Inc is unsuccessful in their proposal to secure funding, PNI will continue to support the Gnosis Chain network; however, in an effort to do so sustainably, PNI would introduce per-second rate limits on the Public RPC that would channel users and developers to a paid tier in the Pocket Portal where costs would be passed on directly to Gnosis builders/users outside the free tier of 250k requests per day.

A decentralized RPC protocol is crucial for a blockchain that values decentralization such as Gnosis Chain. Public RPCs are a public good, Pocket Network hopes to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users.

Body: This proposal re-attempts to change kinship mechanics so that kinship points are burned during each Gotchi channeling event. Current alchemica emission trajectories forecast an annual increase of 40% in supply due to persistent increases in Gotchi kinship multipliers at no cost to the player. The proposed change is a -2 kinship point burn per each gotchi channeling event. Additionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to \"NO to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship. Some benefits of this proposal: Players will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games. Develops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility. There is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games. The specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change. Alchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets. The Graph of FUD emissions below shows the short and long-run effects of this proposal. Emissions reductions would be immediate and their impacts long-lasting if implemented. For example, after 1 year of implementation the emissions reductions is about -55% from the current trajectory & -20% reduction from a baseline of 0. ![[image]]([link]) Potential Risks: Players with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is. Less engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity. Additional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers. This work was the result of several peoples efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards.

[link] Summary: Proposal to add gauge support for the newly created Radiant 80/20 RDNT/WETH pool which is currently the largest liquidity pool on Balancer Arbitrum. The Radiant Capital DAO, a week into its v2 launch on Arbitrum and days from adding its second chain (BNB chain) to become DeFis 1st omnichain money market, has approved and implemented a Balancer 80/20 RDNT/WETH pool as its primary liquidity hub on Arbitrum via DAO governance[RFP-3.]([link]) With v2, the DAO has fully aligned its tokenomics for activities that are compatible with the DAOs collective-benefit ethos and a long-termism mindset. The results of this new Balancer pool have exceeded all expectations, and its first weeks volume was greater than all Arbitrum pools combined. To leverage this successful position further, the DAO is optimistically establishing this gauge and proposing to enable BAL emissions. References/Useful links: Website [link] Documentation [link] Github Page [link] Communities [link] Other useful links? [link] [link] [link] [link] [link] [link] Protocol Description: Radiant aims to be the first omnichain money market where users can deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow various supported assets across multiple chains. The Radiant DAOs primary goal is to consolidate the ~$20 billion of fragmented liquidity (lending TVL) dispersed across the top ten alternative layers (source:[DefiLlama]([link])) Lenders who provide liquidity to Radiant are interacting and providing utility to the platform. In addition, lenders can capture the added value from the communities' engagement through the native token $RDNT. Borrowers can withdraw against collateralized assets to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling their assets and closing their positions. Motivation: The Radiant DAO aims to be the most fee-earning & omnichain protocol in crypto whilst ushering in the next 100m of new DeFi users. Adding this gauge to the robust[Dynamic liquidity]([link]) vault (current liquidity is 30+m within its first week) represents another step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity on the rapidly growing Arbitrum chain. Details: 1. Governance: The Radiant DAO governance model can be found here: [link] 2. Oracles: Radiant price feeds are secured by[Chainlink oracles]([link]) 3. Omnichain: The RDNT token in v2 is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token and the v2 dApp provides users with an innovative borrow & bridge function via Layer0s stargate stable router interface. 4. Audits: While Radiant v2 is primarily composed of the same codebase as Radiant v1  the Radiant DAO takes safety & security seriously and tripled down on audits. We did multiple top-to-bottom v2 audits with[Peckshield]([link]) and[Zokyo]([link]), with zero unresolved critical or high issues.[BlockSec]([link]) was also hired for white hat hacking with zero unresolved issues. 5. Centralization vectors: 1. The Radiant DAO asserts that the networks governance, development, or usage is not centralized. and progressively gets more decentralized as the number of RDNT token holders grows. Together. with Fenwick, Radiant set up the Radiant DAO governance portal (dao.radiant.capital) and ratified. the first two governance proposals, RFP-1, and RFP-2, on which RDNT token holders voted. 2. The Radiant DAO Constitution includes a very clear process for the community to discuss, propose, and vote on new measures, regardless of whether the team ceases to exist. This includes. technical changes, improvements, bug fixes, protocol changes (emissions, allocation points), or. other protocol improvements. The establishment of the DAO formalizes this, as well as voting power. through RDNT liquidity tokens. 3. The smart contracts are verified, and any community member may propose changes or. improvements. Several community members who are not affiliated with the project at launch have. been brought on as \"core contributors in developing smart contract improvements and helping. manage portions of the Radiant community. 4. Because Radiant was built on a similar framework to Aave and Geist, many of the core contracts. are upgradable by the owner. To mitigate security concerns and foster transparency, all Radiant. smart contracts are placed behind a[timelock]([link] security/security-timelock), with a two-day delay for any action. The Radiant team has no intentions. to ever push upgrades to these contracts except to address a critical vulnerability. We will. prominently inform the community prior to any admin-related actions involving the timelock and. encourage community members to monitor inbound transactions to the timelock address. The. Radiant team will always announce all admin-related actions prior to queuing them in the timelock. 5. 48,000 unique wallets have interacted with the protocol. Administrative functions within the smart. contracts are under timelock and Gnosis multisig. The committee that manages that multisig was. ratified as part of Radiant DAOs first proposal,[RFP-1] ([link]) 6. Market History: Radiant fair launched on 7/24/2022 and was self-funded with no VCs. Radiant v1 became the top lending protocol on Arbitrum with 148.45m TVL before the transition to v2. 7. Value: This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Radiant on Arbitrum. In addition, the Radiant DAO sees the value of this gauge in alignment with other protocols in the ecosystem and sees potential and value in doing so with Balancer. Specifications. Gauge Weight Cap. The RDNT v2 token and pool is quite new. Based on its mcap, weighting and fee contributions, it sits just on the boarder of the [Capped Gauge Framework]([link]), sitting currently slightly over the limit allowing for an uncapped gauge based on high trading fees. The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back in to the gauge via Core Pool Bribes. A Gauge capped at 10% provides more than enough room for these activities for the foreseeable future. In order to alleviate any concerns around RDNT being used in an \"capture most of the pool and over-vote for it\" scheme, a voluntary 10% cap has been placed on the gauge. Radiant may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57. Gauge Type. Note that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers. Core Pools Designation: While this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the [BIP-19]([link]) boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the RDNT/WETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19. Details of Gauge to be whitelisted. 1. Gauge address: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) 2. Pool address: [hexadecimals] The specific actions of authorizing the DAO multisig, adding the gauge, and removing the authorization using the gauge address above are included in the linked payload.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOIu9kzCOOzbcGMQolrUwViNW8wT", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954276, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests adding support for the Radiant 80/20 RDNT/WETH pool on Balancer Arbitrum.

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets. Motivation. Chaos Labs' Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range. Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here]([link]) You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page]([link]) The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters. ![Untitled (30) (1)png]([link]) ![Untitled (31) (1)png]([link]) Liquidity Analysis: The TVL in Aave on Optimism (118.71M$) is concentrated primarily on three blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (34%), WETH (28%), and WBTC (14%) Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%) Positions Analysis. We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap]([link]) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave. Given the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react.

(Visualization can be seen here: Visualization of Proposed Structure [link]) Background: When the Olympus Protocol was launched, a set of Gnosis Safes was created to: - Own the Smart Contracts. - Hold Treasury Assets in Main Net. - Hold Working Capital for the DAO. - Manage Policy Parameters. - Hold Assets in other chains. The main multisig (hitherto known as the \"DAO Multisig) ([hexadecimals]) was established to be the Governor and manage the treasury so as to provide decentralized protection of its assets. Additionally, OHM from each reserve bond sold was allocated to the DAO Multisig, providing an operational runway for DAO Operations Protocol-Owned assets have predominantly remained in the treasury contracts along with a network of allocators (Proxy Contracts) that enable deployments into other protocols. From time to time, treasury assets have also been migrated to the DAO Multisig, which acts as both a clearinghouse and temporary allocator as defined by smart contract logic. As a result, the DAO Multisig contains both treasury assets and OHM controlled by the DAO for working capital. The DAO has worked to ensure that these two groups of assets are treated as distinct ledgers so as not to commingle DAO Funds and Treasury Funds. Proposal: The Treasury Team proposes that funds be formally segmented into discrete Multisigs such that the on-chain data creates transparent and separate ledgers for each purpose: - Protocol Treasury - DAO Working Capital Signing authority for each of the new Multisig will remain 4/8 and drawn from the same pool of signers that exist today. Mechanically, this will just create a hard fork of our books on-chain. The Treasury Team also recommends the following recharacterizations Changes in Nomenclature: [hexadecimals] - TRSRY.

This will be capped at $400,000 every two weeks. Background: TAP-15 permitted Olympus DAO to explore the use of incentives as a means to boost voting power to its LP Gauges. Starting the week of March 6th, 2023, Olympus Treasury committed $100,000 USDC to its OHM/ETH Pool located on AURA as a pilot. The results of these efforts were favorable and resulted in the pool seeing between 10-14% vAPR over the epoch. As part of the strategic vision outlined in the recent Treasury RFC, we plan to keep the AURA and use it to increase our market share within the AURA Ecosystem. This will also be used to further vote the gauges that tactically align with our proposed policy. The other rewards will preferably be managed through OTC offers to further increase our AURA position and Balancer Gauge Weight (This is subject to a cap of 5% of veBAL Voting Power) Proposal: The Treasury Team requests community approval of a per epoch (Two Week) budget, not to exceed $400,000, for use in Hidden Hand / Paladin incentivized markets. This will serve as a means of efficiently increasing our $AURA and $BAL ownership over time while simultaneously receiving high emissions towards our OHM pools. The list of potential assets used to incentivize will include: OHM (Preferred) USDC. DAI. FRAX. OHM utilized will either come from OHM already owned by the Treasury or minted specifically for this purpose. Proceeds will be managed to ensure the process is accretive (even in the case of new OHM entering circulating supply) For example: For the 3/6/23 AURA/HH Epoch, 88k net incentives yielded 1.55m votes. These votes produced approximately $123,000 estimated incremental yield. Therefore, this was accretive to Treasury and favorably impacted Liquid Backing. Additionally, this is consistent with our goals of accumulating increased governance power in the Balancer ecosystem. This budget will exist for the remainder 2023, at which time the budget will be re-evaluated for size and scope.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJCDUDf4CWVaMIWrwAzdTW0KhbJ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954294, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests setting up a budget of $400,000 every two weeks to offer incentives in the voting market.

The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe its crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO. DAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. Thats why I am running for the position of treasurer. The purpose of the treasurer role would be to: - Ensure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without missinterprertation possible. - Ensure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc. - Prepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all. - Stay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury. Additionally, the role would also serve as an \"expert\" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO.

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative. Dated: 2023-03-22. Summary. DeFi Saver is a Dapp that allows users to actively manage and take leveraged positions on Aave and other protocols. This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of the FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism liquidity pools. If this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for DeFi Saver users using Aave would be waived. The Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave protocol and the increased borrow volume. Abstract. this proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools. Motivation. DeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020. Currently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees. The ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users' funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded. However, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue. This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools. Implementation. This proposal aims to implement a single AIP, utilizing three similar payloads (one for each network), which will simply call addFlashBorrower on the ACL_MANAGER contract. Limitation. This AIP grants permission to whitelist any DeFi Saver contract for all use cases, such as leveraged positions, EMODE, debt and collateral swaps, with one exception: no smart-contract that migrates a position outside of the Aave ecosystem is eligible for whitelisting.

We are seeking community input on the best course of action for utilizing these tokens to benefit the Aave ecosystem. Options for $ARB Token Allocation 1. Keep the tokens and participate in Arbitrum governance as the Aave DAO: This option involves holding onto the $ARB tokens and using them to actively participate in Arbitrum governance, thereby contributing to the development and decision-making of the Arbitrum L2 ecosystem. 2. Use the tokens to fund a Liquidity Mining program to support the growth of Aave V3 Arbitrum Market: This option would allocate the $ARB tokens towards a Liquidity Mining program designed to incentivize users to participate in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Market, promoting growth and adoption of Aave on the Arbitrum L2. 3. Sell the tokens for stablecoins or ETH to support the Aave DAO treasury: This option involves converting the received $ARB tokens into stablecoins or ETH, which would bolster the Aave DAO treasury and provide additional resources for future development and initiatives. 4.

An issue was recently identified with the Conflicting Votes' process defined in the FOX Governance Process. If passed, this proposal will address the issue by updating the Conflicting Votes' instructions. Abstract. The FOX Governance process currently includes the following instructions for how to handle Conflicting Votes: \"From time to time there may be conflicting proposals. To avoid issues, the Ideation phase can also serve as time for anyone to list their preferred alternative option on the forum. Each proposal on an associate topic will have a [TOPIC] block placed in its title. After that time, a formal proposal will be put forward including all options available to move forward with that received majority support in Ideation. This will ensure that everyone has the ability to surface their preferences while keeping decision timelines reasonably short. Fun fact: this language was forked from Gitcoin DAOs Governance Process . However, ShapeShifts governance process differs from Gitcoins in that there is a mandatory 3-day phase prior to the Ideation phase known as Incubation. Recently, while SCP-131 was in Ideation, a counter proposal, SCP-128, was submitted to the Incubation stage. By the time SCP-131 had passed Ideation, SCP-128 had not yet been submitted to Ideation. This begged the question as to whether SCP-131 could proceed to the official voting phase or needed to wait to see if SCP-128 entered and passed Ideation so the Conflicting Proposals process could be applied. In this case, the proposer of SCP-131 kindly agreed to wait for SCP-128 to go through Ideation, but noted that the Conflicting Votes process should be amended to prevent indefinite delays in the future. Motivation. This proposal updates the language of the Conflicting Votes section of the FOX Governance Process to prevent indefinite delays in the Governance Process and to provide clear guidance to the community for when a counter proposal must be submitted in order for the Conflicting Votes process to apply. Specification. If this proposal is passed, the Conflicting Votes section of the FOX Governance Process will be updated to the following: Conflicting Proposals Conflicting proposals are proposals that are active at the same time and address the same issue or are mutually exclusive. In the case of a conflicting proposal, the Ideation phase can also serve as time for anyone to post their preferred alternative option on the forum. For the Conflicting Proposals process to apply, counter proposals must be published in [Proposal Discussion]([link]) before the Ideation phase of the original proposal concludes, and should include \"[Counter Proposal to SCP-X]\" where X is the corresponding SCP. To avoid delays in the governance process, any counter proposal that follows the format requirements of Ideation and is published before the conclusion of the original proposal must be included as a voting option when the Original proposal is put up for final vote. Benefits. The proposed improvements to the Conflicting Votes section provide necessary clarity and time constraints. Drawbacks. These changes would enable any properly formatted counter proposal to skip the ideation process and go straight to final governance, which could result in un-vetted ideas as proposal options or even passing. It also provides less space for feedback and iterations on counter proposals. However, if a counter proposal isn't viable, its less likely to pass. Further, counter proposals can still gather feedback and continue being iterated on until the final proposal is published.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJCz6IAoIMpPvCF2HCV211UmIHq", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954294, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal aims to fix an issue in the FOX Governance Process where conflicting votes cause delays in decision-making.

Author: SlagathorTheMammothKing7632. GotchiID: 11146. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote duration: 7 days. Discourse Thread: [link] Voting Options: Yes; No; Abstain. This is a proposal from Origin Protocol to convert $2m DAI of the 25% allocated to the DAO treasury from closing the curve into OUSD to generate passive yield for the Aavegotchi treasury. OUSD generates passive yield while sitting in a wallet, and is able to generate higher yields than using any single protocol strategy manually. Backed 1:1 by USDC, DAI, and USDT at all times; yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) though a positive rebase in the form of additional OUSD, proportional to the amount of OUSD held. OUSD yield is currently ~5% APY, but it has ranged from as low as 4.08% APY and as high as 198.24% APY over the past month. OUSD yield comes from a combination of: - Lending collateral to Aave, Compound, Morpho, Curve, and Convex. - Reward tokens (AAVE, COMP, CRV, and CVX) are automatically claimed and converted to stablecoin. - A 25bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OUSD via the dapp (completely avoidable if using DEX or CEX), this fee goes back to OUSD holders. - OUSD sitting in non-upgradable contracts (more than half the OUSD in existence) does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase. There are no lock-ups, terms, or conditions with OUSD; its completely non-custodial. Any web3 wallet should be able to support OUSD and its rebasing function, including hardware wallets and multi-sigs. Theres no need to ever again give up the keys to a 3rd party platform, such as Celsius, Blockfi, or FTX, to earn yield. Background on Origin Protocol. Origin was founded by Web3 veterans Josh Fraser and Matthew Liu in 2017 and is one of the most venerable projects in the space. Josh and Matthew are joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors.

Summary. This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add LDO to the Ethereum V3 Liquidity Pool. Abstract. LDO would be the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol governance token to be listed on Aave. Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDOs price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai. The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers. Motivation. Lido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs. The Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract]([link]) Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools.

Zane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Jordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance) Summary. Deploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team. Match CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools. Metronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite. Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS. Revisions. This proposal is a revision of a previous proposal. The following changes were made: CVX match reduced to 110,000 and broken down between msUSD-fraxBP and msETH-frxETH. sfrxETH collateral has already been deployed to Metronome. Background and Motivation. Metronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project Vesper - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle) Metronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on. Specifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a \"yield-plus experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY) Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an \"msETH synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today. This mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome) In return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities. Section 0: Pool Deployment. Frax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight. Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget. Frax team will match 110,000 CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months) Metronome treasury currently holds [roughly 165,000 CVX]([link]) We intend to split the composite 220,000 CVX (110,000 matched 1:1) as follows: msUSD-FraxBP: 150,000 CVX msETH-frxETH: 70,000 CVX. This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges. Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper. Currently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome. As of recently, sfrxETH is also integrated as collateral onto Metronome. Vesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include: Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX Aave v3 sfrxETH-borrow-Stablecoins Future strategies as they become available. The Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral. Section 3: Program Extension. The above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS. In particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY. Should there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program. In addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome. In the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains. Lastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO. Summary. Prioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome. Frax to match 110,000 CVX voting weight with Metronome for four voting cycles. Frax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways: New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders. Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions. Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on. Voting.

Gitcoin is the worlds largest implementer of quadratic funding. We have run 105 quadratic funding rounds, helped fund over 3,700 projects, and grown ecosystems like Uniswap, Polygon, and ENS. Yet, we aren't currently using quadratic funding ourselves. With the recent launch of the Allo protocol, Gitcoin should be one of the first ecosystems to use the protocol to fund its shared needs. This proposal is to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds for rewarding efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by Gitcoin Citizens 2. Citizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of the DAO. Running these rounds will lower the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determine what the community values most, and help test (dogfood) the Allo protocol. For this we are requesting a total of $95K in GTC from the Gitcoin treasury, more details below. Abstract. Through using our protocol and products, we'll be able to better understand what works and what could be improved from both a funding and technology perspective. In particular, we'll be able to test two different approaches to quadratic funding: normal QF and retroQF. Normal QF (the kind we see in Grants Rounds) can fund both completed and planned work, while RetroQF exclusively funds work which has already had an observable impact. Because of this, RetroQF may be better at distributing funds according to the value actually created by a contribution but is not suited to situations where contributors can't afford to wait for compensation. We will try both methods to gain information about which is better suited to the unique needs of our community. By running different styles of rounds repeatedly and quickly, we'll be able to gain valuable insight into how to best fund grantees, improve our products, and empower our community. We will also identify what contributions our community finds valuable so that in subsequent rounds people have more information when choosing what to work on.

Summary. In July 2022 Balancer passed [BIP-24]([link]) which allocates 200K BAL (~$1.3M) to a Ribbon BAL Covered Call treasury vault. The call-writing strategy has significantly outperformed buy-and-hold since inception, earning 221,885.41 USDC for the Balancer subDAO [treasury]([link]) Currently, 4.16% (200K / 4.8M BAL) of the treasury BAL is allocated to the Ribbon vault. We propose to increase the allocation of BAL to the vault. Motivation. The original rationale for BIP-24 still stands today: 1. We are still in the midst of a significant bear market both for the price of BAL and for DeFi assets overall. This thesis was validated since BIP-24 8 months ago: BAL has remained range-bound between ~$4.5 - ~$7.8 from July to March (fig. 1) 2. The DAO wanted to explore ways to bolster stablecoin reserves  indeed the strategy has shown results, earning 221K USDC on $1.3M worth of BAL. !(upload://[image]) Figure 1 We think it is prudent to increase the allocation at this time for the following reasons: 1. Implied volatility has been picking up recently, thus, selling calls is more attractive and is rewarding sellers more appropriately for the risk they are taking. One can observe below the 2-weeks implied volatility of ETH, which is a good proxy to see how implied volatility is moving for altcoins too (fig. 2) 2. Since BIP-24, more market makers and institutional players have been participating in Ribbon Auctions for altcoins, making the bidding process more competitive. As a result, over the 8 months these options trade at increasingly tighter spreads and higher premiums, effectively generating more revenue for the DAO. 3. While the strategy has been performing well so far, the current performance is quite path-dependent and we could structure this second vault to reduce the path-dependency of the initial covered call strategy (see implementation) !(upload://[image]) Figure 2 Current Strategy. Since inception, the current strategy generated 221,885.41 USDC. This converts to 22.58% realised yield using the initial BAL deposit of 200k BAL, which was worth roughly $982,681.77. Using the current BAL price of $6.58, this converts to 16.86% It is possible that some of the following options end up in-the-money in which case the strategy may have a lower return and possibly underperform buy-and-hold. I want to refrain from using \"APR for this very reason, since it is a trade and not a loan, but annualizing both figures, this would convert to 33.23% and 24.13% APR respectively. Out of the 8 trades expired, only one expired in-the-money, resulting in a loss of 3,474.75 BAL. One can compare the current strategy to a simple buy-and-hold strategy by looking at the graph below. !(upload://[image]) One can find the raw data below. !(upload://[image]) The current covered call strategy is outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy significantly so far. Implementation. While the current strategy is selling monthly 25% OTM options, we propose to also sell biweekly 20% OTM options. As this strategy will be rebalanced on different schedules and different strikes will be chosen compared to the monthly strategy, it will effectively reduce the path-dependency of the overall portfolio, leading to lower drawdowns overall. The amount of BAL we allocate needs to match the BAL in the current strategy for it to be effective. In the current market conditions, the additional biweekly layer is expected to yield 1.22% every two weeks (paid out in USDC) Obviously, this premium will change on a trade per trade basis but if you want to have an idea of what it would mean in APR terms, this converts to an APR of 31.69% This proposal will be a vote on how much to increase the current strategy by, and by extension the allocation for the biweekly 20% OTM options strategy. Conclusion. Since July 2022, this strategy has earned 221,000 USDC on $1.3M BAL for the subDAO due to a bearish / sideways / low realized volatility thesis. We believe these conditions will continue for a while given the macroeconomic. If the community agrees with this thesis, then it may be prudent to double-down (7%-15% treasury allocation) to increase profits and minimize path dependency. Risks Market Risk: The primary risk for running this covered call strategy is that the vault may incur a biweekly loss in the case where the call options sold by the vault expire in-the-money (meaning the price of BAL is above the strike price of the call options minted by the vault) Smart Contract Risk: The Theta Vault smart contracts have been [audited by OpenZeppelin]([link]) and [ChainSafe]([link]) Balancer has been in this strategy for 8 months without smart contract exploits despite that, we always advise to exercise caution and only risk funds they can afford to lose. Voting. This vote is to determine whether to allocate 200k BAL to this new Ribbon Vault. Note that the depositor (the Balancer subDAO) has the flexibility to downsize the position, add to the position, or exit the strategy entirely. Specification. If approved, the DAO Multisig 'eth:[hexadecimals]' will call approve on the BAL token contract '[hexadecimals]' with spender '[hexadecimals]' and amount '200000000000000000000000' This will allow the new Ribbon vault contract to spend 200k BAL. Then the DAO Multisig 'eth:[hexadecimals]' will call deposit on the Ribbon vault contract '[hexadecimals]' with amount '200000000000000000000000' This will deposit 200k BAL in the Ribbon vault.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJDIQ7d4sA1NLddjP25rttu52iD", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954295, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal suggests increasing the allocation of BAL tokens to a new Ribbon Vault, which focuses on call writing strategies.

The proposal was approved earlier this year. As noted by Solarcurve, some specifications within BIP-146 were purposefully left as soft requirements to allow for future flexibility. This current proposal, based on extensive feedback from Balancer and Aura Contributors, seeks to finalize those provisions, so that projects adopting the 80/20 model have a working framework to follow during their grant application process. Specifications A. BIP-146 suggested the following milestones for grant qualification: - 25k BAL. - TVL exceeds value of 25k BAL by 30x. - TVL exceeds $4.125M. - Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $45.8k. - 50K BAL. - TVL exceeds value of 50k BAL by 30x. - TVL exceeds $8.25M. - Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $275k. This proposal increases requirements in BAL terms to make them closer to the revenue added to the system. At a market price of $7.00 USD, this amendment revises the first two milestones to the following, with no changes to the latter two milestones in BIP-146: - 25k BAL. - TVL exceeds value of 50K BAL by 25x. - TVL exceeds $8.75M. - Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $280K. - 50K BAL. - TVL exceeds value of 50K BAL by 60x. - TVL exceeds $21M. - Lifetime total revenue earned exceeds $630K. B. BIP-146 stated that \"All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL and ideally the project will provide the necessary 20% of ETH so that no BAL is sold. This proposal amends this provision by requiring projects to provide the necessary ETH against any BAL granted, so that no BAL is indirectly sold. C. BIP-146 did not provide guidance as to how granted BAL would be managed by grantee. As stated by [Fernando]([link]), \"My biggest fear with the way this proposal is stated is that [BAL granted goes directly to grantees possession] and then not much can be done to guarantee its intended use.In other words nothing prevents you from stopping unlocking and then withdrawing the underlying BAL and WETH in a year to your treasury.Its also possible that both [parties] agree for whatever reason it makes sense for you to stop re-locking, in this case I firmly think you should keep the ETH you added (it will be constantly rebalanced to 20% of the pool so it might be more or less than you added depending on how the pool evolved) and Balancer DAO should keep the BAL. This proposal establishes a trustless non-custodial relationship for the granted BAL, accessible by both grantor and grantee. Aura Contributors have developed a VeBalGrant contract with the following specifications to meet this requirement: - Project Functions: - Increase locked amount in veBAL using BPT balance. - Increase veBAL lock time. - Claim fees from distributor. - Create initial lock for the grant. - Balancer Functions: - Change the active state of the grant should the grantee break rules of the grant or both parties decide to end it, winding down the lock and giving Balancer control over gauge voting. - Shared Functions: - Release veBAL lock when the grant is inactive. - Redeem BPT position for WETH and BAL when the grant is inactive. - Withdraw and distribute WETH and BAL balances to project and balancer when inactive. - Conditionally Shared Functions. If grant state is active they are only callable by the project, once inactive they are only callable by Balancer. - Vote for a gauge with specified weight. - Execute contract calls with restricted access to some. We strongly encourage each party to review the contract code and associated tests thoroughly. The links to the contract and tests can be found below: [Contract Link]([link]) [Fork Test Link]([link]) D. BIP-146 notes \"that only TVL and revenue from locked liquidity [i.e. ve8020 pools] will be counted towards the milestones. Further, Solarcurve states, \"We only want BAL emissions going to locked liquidity.If you open this up to include systems where BAL emissions go to unlocked liquidity theres little reason to have this program imo, since you're now competing with basically every pool we have earning emissions. The key here is getting a lot of locked liquidity on Balancer that is predominantly paid for by other mechanisms besides BAL emissions. This proposal clarifies that protocol owned liquidity owned by a protocol qualifies as \"locked liquidity, and expands the definition of this term for the purposes of this grant to be only those pools used in the ve8020 pool.

Proposal summary. Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM. Overview of proposal. We propose to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswaps protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as \"zkEVM on behalf of the community. We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons: Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility. An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations. A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values. About Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: - L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2); - Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1); - Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS); - Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more. The Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured. Motivation. Theres significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswaps place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, its only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority. Partner Details. Polygon Labs. This proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks. Partner Legal. The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as \"Polygon Labs. Delegate Sponsor. There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community. Conflict of Interest Declaration. There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswaps legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures. KPI & Success Criteria. Target KPIs. There are generally 2 forms of projects: 1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here. ![[image]]([link]) 2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives) These are more completion based. ![[image]]([link]) What does success look like? Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswaps Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade. What potential risks are there for this projects success? How could they be mitigated? Risk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereums core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. The bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygons zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain. Protocol security. Please address the following questions if you're proposing a cross-chain deployment: Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? There are two ways to use the bridge: - Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that. - Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Here we assume no possibility for fraud. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJC0HyteCpViizmcQJ0aOqCKOQC", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954294, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that Uniswap v3 should be deployed on the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM).

Since BitDAOs launch in July 2021, we have explored various strategies, and received datapoints from community feedback, price performance, and observations of other crypto projects. To optimize BitDAOs long-term prosperity and competitiveness within a dynamic crypto industry, it is imperative that we periodically review BitDAO structuring. This proposal is intended to address the following key issues that arose from feedback and observations: 1. The lack of focus of the BitDAO strategy and narratives - the community has supported a variety of initiatives and pilot programs, including: the initial and ongoing Bybit Contribution, venture investments, broad mandate ecosystem initiatives, and core product development led by Mantle and various ad hoc projects. This multi-strategy approach lacks competitive strength, and it is preferred that BitDAO looks for its own long term vision with clear focus of strategies and resources. 2. The unpredictable nature of the $BIT circulating supply (due to the dynamic Bybit Contribution) 3. The concentration of $BIT token holdings. This proposal aims to take first steps to deal with the above issues through simple adjustments to existing mechanisms. The intended result is: a focus on product and user growth (instead of treasury growth); a focus on BitDAO initiatives instead of Bybit; increased the stability and predictability of $BIT tokenomics; and decentralization of $BIT holdings and governance. Proposal. By voting \"Yes\" on this proposal, you are in favor of: 1. Modifying the Bybit Contribution from a dynamic exchange-linked-amount to a fixed-schedule-amount over 48 months, starting at 120M $BIT per month and halving every 12 months (total 2.7B units) 2. Retaining the Bybit Contribution $BIT in the BitDAO Treasury instead of immediately burning. The burn may be restarted via a subsequent BitDAO proposal. New Bybit Contribution Schedule |Period|$BIT per Month|Total $BIT tokens| | --- | ---: | ---: | |First 12 months [1]|120,000,000|1,440,000,000| |Next 12 months|60,000,000|720,000,000| |Next 12 months|30,000,000|360,000,000| |Next 12 months|15,000,000|180,000,000| |||2,700,000,000| Notes: [1] The first contribution under the new schedule shall be 2023 April 20th, in replacement of the contribution under the old model. Analysis and Commentary. Fixed-Schedule Contribution. The existing Bybit Contribution depends on the dynamic trading volume. Modifying this to a fixed schedule brings the following benefits: 1. Focus $BIT tokenomics on BitDAO initiatives such as the development and adoption of core $BIT products (e.g. Mantle), instead of Bybit performance. 2. Focus BitDAO on products and user growth, instead of treasury growth. While treasury resources are critical for development and longevity, BitDAO prosperity is primarily accelerated and sustainable through product and user adoption. 3. Decouple the economic and legal exposures of BitDAO and Bybit. Reduce the likelihood of $BIT being viewed as a \"Centralized Exchange Token\" or \"Bybit Token\" Reduce risk from future regulations around Centralized Exchange Tokens. Pave the way for $BIT to be listed on other centralized exchanges (which may view Bybit as a competitor) 4. Increase the predictability of $BIT tokenomics. More predictable $BIT circulating supply. Easier to benchmark $BIT to other tokens. 5. Improve the decentralization of $BIT holdings and governance. Each future contribution tranche furthers the decentralization of $BIT holdings, from Bybit-owned to community-owned-and-distributed via the BitDAO Treasury. Bybits Support for BitDAO Products. Bybit has contributed more than $600M USDC/USDT and 177k ETH to the BitDAO treasury (see [Treasury Monitor Analytics]([link])) This level of resources is sufficient to support the development of BitDAO products. There is a high standard for approving new initiatives, as we should ensure deployment of BitDAO resources has a direct impact on long-term BitDAO prosperity. That being said, Bybit remains an important sponsor and partner to the BitDAO community. BitDAO will continue to partner with Bybit in terms of technology development and product adoption, particularly in the areas of product ideation, bootstrapping product development, $BIT integration, user integration, and product distribution. We believe such support will create more value for the BitDAO community. As an example, the early stages of [Mantle]([link]) development was funded by Bybit until the recent Mantle budget proposal under BitDAO. Mantle will use $BIT as native token (versus having its own token), and be BitDAO governed and accountable (see [BIP-19 Budget Proposal]([link]), [Mantle Ecofund Proposal]([link]), and [Mantle zkEVM Discussions]([link])) After completion of the 2.7B $BIT fixed-schedule contribution, Bybit will likely remain the largest holder of $BIT and be incentivized in BitDAOs success ([see wallet holdings]([link])) Tokenomic Impact. The resultant supply impact of this proposal is that the circulating supply of $BIT (defined as outside of the BitDAO Treasury and Burn address) will be reduced from approximately 6.0 bln units (3.3bln treasury, 0.7 bln burned) to 3.3 bln units (6.0 bln treasury, 0.7 bln burned) This represents a 1.8x boost of BitDAO economics and governance voting power for all existing $BIT holders. Note: the circulating supply of $BIT will be increased from any distributions and issuance from BitDAO Treasury (approved by future BIPs), and decreased via any approved burn, $BIT token sinks designed into core products, or BIT purchase programs.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJDMQpEd5v8ADYWdbEVgPfR9e4L", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954295, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests making changes to the structure of BitDAO to address certain issues identified by the community.

Project: [link] Whitepaper: [link] Github: [link] Documentation: [link] Audit: [link] wstETH: [link] Chainlink: [link] Governance: [link] Twitter: [link] Discord: [link] Summary. This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool. Motivation. The stETH Reserve on Aave v2 is the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.52B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.99B) and ETH ($1.16B) On Aave v3, the most recent Aave deployment, wstETH provides $130M or 29% of markets TVL. Several communities building on Aave utilize the wstETH/wETH rewards-maximizing strategy to generate rewards on various assets. By adding wstETH to the Polygon v3 market, users gain access to a third Liquid Staking Token (LST) source of rewards. The demand for wETH on Aave has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave v2. This led to a material increase in Aaves wETH nominated revenue stream. Listing wstETH across various Aave deployments, has enabled Aave to offer the higher APR on wETH deposits, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Polygon, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating a similar outcome to that of the Ethereum Aave v2 and v3 Liquidity Pool. !([link]]) The utilization of wETH on Polygon is 10.07%, compared to 48.37% on the Ethereum v2 wETH Reserve. Listing wstETH on Polygon v3 will increase TVL for Aave and generate new demand for wETH borrowing, creating demand for wETH deposits and driving growth for Aave. !([link]]) Specification. 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? Jacob is a full time contributor to the Lido DAO. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token? Lido is the name given to a suite of liquid staking smart contract systems deployed across multiple blockchain network platforms. The smart contract systems are software middleware that extend the functionality of the networks by enabling more participants to stake the network native token. The Lido on Ethereum software is deployed on the Ethereum network. When participants use it to route their stake, they enhance the security of the Ethereum network by increasing the number of participants who stake ETH. Lido on Ethereum does not record the wallet address of participants that use it. Instead participants use the middleware to mint a rebasing stETH utility token to themselves when they route their stake. The utility tokens are fungible and liquid. The total balance of stETH in existence is based on the total amount of ETH staked via the Lido on Ethereum middleware plus total staking rewards minus any slashing applied on validators. stETH rebases daily. Due to the rebasing nature of stETH, a users stETH balance changes daily as staking rewards are reported from the consensus layer. As some DeFi protocols require a constant balance mechanism for tokens, stETH can be wrapped into wstETH which keeps a users token balance fixed and uses deterministic code to account for users' staking reward balances. Example of an unwrapping scenario: 1) User wraps 1 stETH and gets 0.9803 wstETH (1 stETH = 0.9803 wstETH) 2) A rebase happens, the wstETH price goes up by 5% 3) User unwraps 0.9803 wstETH and gets 1.0499 stETH (1 stETH = 0.9337 wstETH) When withdrawals are enabled on the Ethereum network, by the Ethereum Foundation, wstETH users can unwrap the tokens to stETH and then burn the tokens to use the withdrawal functionality of middleware and get their stake and accumulated rewards. wstETH on Polygon: ['[hexadecimals]']([link]) 3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? The below shows the effect that listing of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum Mainnet deployment. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and the resulting fee-revenue. !([link]]) The wETH reserve generated approximately $279k in revenue during January, $244k during February and has already generated $234k by mid March 2023. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The below provides a brief overview and some key dates of interest providing insight into the history to stETH and wstETH: stETH deployed on 17th December 2020 stETH listed on Aave v2 on the 27th February 2022 wstETH deployed 5th August 2022 wstETH listed on Ethereum v3 27th January 2023 wstETH listed on Optimism v3 24th February 2023 wstETH listed on Arbitrum v3 1st March 2023. Lido Protocol stETH is considered the most dominant staked ETH utility token across the industry. stETH tokens make up 31.4% of all staked ETH deposits. !([link]]) 5. How is wstETH currently used? Aave v2 on Ethereum is the largest holder of stETH. Deploying wstETH on Polygon, along with on other networks like Optimism and Arbitrum, will make the token available to Aave users on Layer 2 networks in the same way stETH is available on Ethereum Mainnet. It will also enable DeFi protocols to build interesting and exciting new use cases by utilizing integration with Aave to access the wstETH market. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO, CIAN and others have all built products on top of Aave utilizing the recursive stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Polygon Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Polygon. !([link]]) On Polygon, wstETH is mostly used for providing liquidity on Balancer. In time, this pool will be migrated to wstETH / bb-a-wETH and a gauge will be created to distribute rewards to Liquidity Providers who stake their BPTs. 6. Emission schedule. There is no emission schedule. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? For details on stETH, which is already listed on Aave v2 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism please refer to the following forum posts: [link] [link] [link] Transferring wstETH from Ethereum to Polygon occurs via the Polygon [canonical bridge]([link]) provided by the Polygon Foundation. !([link]]) 8.

We propose adding a gauge to this pool. References/Useful links: - [Morpho Website]([link]) - [Documentation]([link]) - [Github Page]([link]) - Communities: [Discord]([link]), [Forum]([link]) - [DApp]([link]) - [Analytics]([link]) Protocol Description: Morpho-Aave is a peer-to-peer layer built on top of Aave. It is a lending pool optimizer: it improves the capital efficiency of positions on lending pools by seamlessly matching lenders and borrowers peer-to-peer. By doing so, Morpho-AaveV2 enhances the rates of AaveV2 while preserving the same experience, liquidity, and parameters (collateral factors, oracles, etc.) as the underlying pool. USDC is the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. USDT is the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Tether. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. Motivation: The Morpho-Aave boosted pool enhances Balancers capacity to improve capital efficiency through linear and boosted pool architecture. While Aave has been commonplace for Balancer boosted pools in the past, the bb-ma2-USD pool enables LPs to access improved yield compared to the original bb-a-USD pool. Encouraging liquidity on the pool through gauges will leverage this improved yield, making it even more appealing for LPs. This will ultimately result in better trading conditions for the three stablecoins. Specifications: 1. Governance: Morpho-Aave Core contracts are owned by a 5/9 multisig safe with a 24-hour timelock. Multisig decisions reflect the choices of the Morpho token holders. A 3/9 multisig can execute quick, non-critical actions, such as pausing a market when required. For more information on Governance, see [this page.]([link]) USDC and USDT are centralized and do not have governance forums. DAI is collateralized by [MakerDAO.]([link]) 2. Oracles: Morpho-AaveV2 relies on the same oracles as AaveV2, used in bb-a-usd. 3. Security: - [Audits:]([link]) The protocol has been audited numerous times by the best audit firms in the world. - [Bug Bounty]([link]): Moprho has a Bug bounty of $555,555, live since 17 June 2022. - [Formal Proving]([link]): Morpho formally proves its contracts using [Certora]([link]) and Morpho Labss internal formal prover. 4. Centralization vectors: USDT and USDC are inherently centralized. 5. Market History: See USDC [here]([link])), USDT [here]([link]), and DAI [here]([link]) 6.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 250, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful crypto expert."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have following proposal:\nin conjunction with the Gnosis Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. Overview of Gnosis Chain. Formerly known as the xDai Chain, Gnosis has been in development since 2018 and has continued to build and grow throughout the years. Gnosis includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other features that enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost transactions, and the ability to construct trustless bridges. The Gnosis Chain team has demonstrated their dedication towards the growth and adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. Gnosis Chains objective is to expedite the advancement of Ethereum and expand its reach. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain will offer various advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. With Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at [link] Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC. Gnosis Chains ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees  an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platforms capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at [link] Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a trustless bridge architecture that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment. The Gnosis Chains unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform. Proposal. This proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that its fair for their work to come into fruition after a year. This proposal comes at a crucial time as Uniswaps V3 license is expiring soon. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise. Echoing the post made by the Gnosis team, supports Uniswap deployment on Gnosis with Wormhole as the bridge provider for a number of reasons. Wormhole was recently voted-in as the bridge provider for Uniswap deployment on BSC. With this in mind, Wormhole has the necessary tools to facilitate deployment on Gnosis Chain due to the already developed mechanisms needed for BSC deployment. While we understand that security is a concern, the extent of Uniswap design that Wormhole will be responsible for are protocol parameters such as fees. We are aware that there is an on-going discussion on using a multi-bridge design; however, it is expected to take months with a high likelihood of delays. On the other hand, deployment on GC is expected to be ready within a week or two after governance approval. Note that we are not against changing this design through governance later on should a more secure and efficient method arise. Final Thoughts. As we stated in our post previously, there is a tradeoff between choosing the most efficient bridge provider and the urgency of deployment. With the bridge assessment committees findings expected to be released far later than the license expiry, its more pressing to cement Uniswaps presence on these chains. Emphasis should be placed on the primary purpose to execute proposals governing this deployment. This ensures that Uniswaps decentralized governance model stays robust and responsive to the evolving needs of the ecosystem, regardless of the underlying chain. We believe that when a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-eRvEEa5v7yC1HwnPonQCuXxW on tokens per min.

Simple Summary. As the Hop DAO opens itself up to more community involvement, it has become increasingly crucial for the DAOs elected positions to have a particular voting system through which nominees are elected into these positions. Motivation. The Hop DAO community must take an active role in the day-to-day decision of the DAO, this is the motivation behind this proposal to decide on the voting system to be used in Hop DAO Elections. Scope. At this time there are primarily two positions in the Hop DAO which this voting system will apply to. Community Multi-Sig Elections The Hop DAO Ambassador Program. NB: This scope can be increased as the Hop DAO evolves over time. Specification. 1. Voting options. 2. Our recommendation. There are currently five voting system options available on Snapshot. Single Choice Voting: A user may only choose one option. These votes will be represented in the results as percentages of the total number of votes that each participant cast on the particular option. Great for picking one option from a variety of options. The primary disadvantage of this system is that voters can only choose one option. Weighted Voting: Each user can distribute their voting power across any number of options, from one to all. By increasing or reducing the voting power fraction, their voting power will be distributed among the options they have picked by the weight they give to each one. The major disadvantage of this system is it adds more complexity to the voting process. Approval Voting: Each choice selected (and approved) by a user has equal voting power; for example, if a user selects two options, both will receive the users entire voting power. This voting system allows for approval and does not allow voters to quantify their approval in percentages or varying degrees. Quadratic Voting: Each user can cast as many votes as desired. Due to the quadratically calculated outcomes, the number of individual voters matters more than the total amount of provided voting power. The power of the whales in this voting system is diluted in favour of smaller holders. The significance of individuals will outweigh the number of tokens. However, this voting type requires a Sybil-resistance method to stop whales from distributing governance power between several wallets. Ranked Choice Voting: Each user must order their rankings of the options. For each voters top pick, votes are tallied in the first phase. A choice wins if it earns more than 50% of the votes, which are cast on the users' top selections. The outcome will display the percentages reflecting users only voted for their top option. This voting system particularly favours options with the most vital support; however, this voting system only produces one winner and is complex to understand and implement. Our recommendation We recommend weighted voting because, although it adds a bit of complexity to the process, voters can quantify their support in percentages for various candidates of their choosing. A voter could give 100% of their vote to a person or split their votes between four candidates by voting 25% each. Giving voters flexibility in deciding who is elected to specific positions would be a valuable approach to running our elections. This voting system allows for the selection of multiple candidates, which is ideal for Hop DAOs elections. Disclosure.

I didn't have a Face Cam though - an Anata VTUBE avatar would have been perfect while playing - which makes chat and video way more interactive.

Timeless Finances protocol,[bunni.pro]([link]), is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP frxETH/WETH gauges in order to receive FXS rewards. Background. Bunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months. Proposal. We propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC 010 [link] Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders. Evaluation of Success. We will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauge by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of frxETH/WETH liquidity pool along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pool receive. Conclusion. Bunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs.

Background & Motivation In a recent statement, StakeDAO announced that they are deprecating their options products: [link] This closure is of relevance as one product, the ETH Put Selling Strategy, occupies a Frax gauge (sdETH-FraxPut) and has associated locked liquidity. StakeDAO users are currently being advised to withdraw from their options position. As such, this author believes the Frax community should vote to unlock the gauge. The ETH Put Selling Strategy (the Strategy) is described on the StakeDAO website: This strategy leverages Opyns oTokens to sell 7-day European ETH put options every Friday to market makers via Airswap. The premium received generates passive income for its users. The position is covered with USD stable coin collateral representing 100% of the face value of the put options sold. The USD stable coin collateral is staked into Stake DAOs Passive FRAX Strategy to generate additional yield. From the Frax perspective, having the position collateralized with FRAX3CRV pool tokens helps with the $FRAX peg. Some community members believe this is sufficient reason alone to reject unlocking (for example, see Dennett: [link]), and I understand this perspective. Indeed, recent market conditions have illustrated the importance of maintaining a strong $FRAX peg. However, the fact remains that the strategy was designed, first and foremost, to sell ETH puts. Lockers had a reasonable expectation that ETH puts would continue to be sold while the gauge persists  this is no longer the case. In terms of numbers: Current gauge weight: 0.28% (~123 FXS per week) Current value locked: 2.5 million USD. Finally, just a broad comment: The partnership between Frax and StakeDAO has been one of the more enjoyable to witness. It has been a pleasure to see how these two teams and communities have supported each other thus far, with supporting products on each platform and many dual community members. Perhaps optimistically, I hope that Frax members will extend this support once more to StakeDAO by unlocking the sdETH-FraxPut gauge, though I am sure the good vibes will continue regardless of the outcome.

Option 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk. Option 3) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk. To vote NAE is to deposit CRV in Aave v3 on the network it was earned. This represents the \"do nothing approach. A Snapshot vote presenting the three options will determine which options will be presented as an AIP. Each option has varying degrees of complexity to implement, with Option 1) being the most difficult in a decentralized way, but more closely aligned with Aaves GHO and staked aToken direction. Motivation. Aave currently holds 696k of CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. To support Aave in choosing how best to manage the CRV holding, Llama presents three high-level strategies to choose between. Option 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions. Option 1) includes locking CRV, participating in Curve Finance governance, and voting to direct incentives to pools of Aaves choosing. veCRV could be used to boost adoption of GHO, yield on staked aToken reserves, and yield on Protocol Owned Liquidity, to name a few potential use cases. Pros Gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission) By locking it 4 years and relocking periodically to get the max voting power, the DAO would be able to redirect 0.0068 CRV/veCRV on the pools of its choice (Most likely directed to a GHO one) With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 4,740 CRV of emission per week, representing $234.13K per year obtained without any additional expenses. Protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool) 50% of all protocol fees on Curve are directed to LPs, and the other 50% goes to veCRV holders. The current APR is 3,43% which is representative of the usual economic activity. With regular volumes, the APR is close to 2-5%, but weeks like USDC depeg, the APR was 15% No extra counterparty risk (No protocol on top of Curve) Unlike the two other options, the CRV will be locked on Curve directly from the Collector contract. This reduces the risks compared to using protocols on top of Curve which adds an additional layer of smart contract counterparty risks. Easy management of the veCRV position & votes Re-locking the veCRV position can be made accessible, via adding a function on the Collector Contract. Llama can then create a bot which automatically calls the function and re-commits the veCRV holding. The veCRV option only requires to lock CRV, no extra token required. When a gauge vote is submitted on Curve, there is no need to revote each week even if the position is increased, unless Aave decides to change the vote. Additional features from holding veCRV Governance Power to participate in the DAO decisions (On-Chain) veBoost which can be sold or utilized to maximize the rewards on the funds deposited: While we agree that the impact will be minimal at first, the veBoost will grow over time with the veCRV holdings, compared to both other solutions where it is lost. Cons 4 unlock period with frequent relock to keep the max voting power The goal of this strategy is to always relock to have the maximum voting power, and increase the position over time with the CRV earned. If Aave decides to stop this strategy at a later stage, the same amount of CRV that was locked will be available after 4 years. Llama can automate the relock periodically to avoid the decay. Complex participation in DAO decisions Governance participation can be challenging with the collector contract because of the important amount of DAO decisions voted, and there is no way to delegate the veCRV governance power. Option 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk. Option 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes), and presents a higher-yielding investment strategy that, over time, will lead to Aave own more CRV relative to Option 1) This option does not offer any governance influence which leads to an easier management. However, considering the recent events such as USDC de-peg and Euler hack which impacted many protocols, Llama believes that security should be prioritized and Aave should proceed with the lowest risk proposal. Pros Gauge weight power profits (Influence on CRV weekly emission) While its not possible to directly vote with st-yCRV, Yearn utilizes the voting power to vote for the highest vote incentives on the market, then sells everything for CRV and compounds the strategy overtime. Boosted protocol fees profits (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool) Yearn utilize its veCRV holdings to boost the distribution of the 3CRV (Currently 1.66x) All 3CRV are collected, sold for CRV and compounded overtime. Temporary MegaBoost in CRV As mentioned earlier in this thread, Yearn decided to distribute 30k CRV/Week for a defined amount of time to maximize the yield. These CRV are also compounded in the strategy. Unless the decision is renewed, this should not be taken into account as the initial incentives should end soon. Easy management of the CRV position Requires a deposit & stake to enter the strategy. The yield sources are collected in, or sold for CRV which are automatically compounded in st-yCRV. No further action is required by Aave post-staking yCRV. Total current APR: 33% Transferable Asset (yCRV) When CRV are deposited on Yearn, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint yCRV at 1:1. These yCRV can be staked for st-yCRV and transferred or sold on the yCRV-CRV pool on Curve. Cons. No direct governance influence All the gauge weight power and 3CRV are sold for CRV, and the governance power and veBoost are kept by Yearn. Extra counterparty risk (Yearn on top of Curve) This solution adds extra smart contract and counterparty risks as required to trust Yearn as a good manager of the strategy. High risk asset profile (Depeg risk) The yCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $8.4M. With the current Aave holdings and yCRV liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k yCRV with a rate of 0.9936:1. However, any selling pressure on the yCRV could lead to Aave incurring significant slippage when trying to exit the position. Option 3) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk. sdCRV was proposed by the Stake DAO team in the comments, and presents as an hybrid solution between maximizing yield and governance influence. However, it requires veSDT holdings or boost delegation to Aave to be considered efficient compared to other solutions. Until recently, the voting power on sdCRV was acquired progressively over a 30 day period. Stake DAO mentioned a parameter change related to asdcrv, but we couldn't find any vote or public announcement about this update. However, even after this period, the voting power of 1 sdCRV was not equal to 1 veCRV if Aave does not lock SDT itself or receive delegation from veSDT holders. Pros Proportional gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission) By depositing 696k CRV on Stake, it would result in a voting power of 0.61 veCRV vote / sdCRV. With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the Aave would control 2,891 CRV of emission per week, representing $142.80K per year obtained without any additional expenses or veSDT boost holdings or delegation. To avoid a SDT acquisition and reduced voting power, Marc Zeller from ACI is to delegate all his veSDT voting power (270k) to Aave for one year, as well as relocking & re-delegating every week enabling Aave to retain the provided boost. Other parties mentioned on the forum said that they consider to delegate, but no one other than ACI confirmed that they will delegate, relock & redelegate frequently or disclosed their holdings to track the delegation, so its not taken into account in this recap. According to AaveChan engagement, the veSDT holding delegation would boost the voting power to 1.14x for 1 year. With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 5,403 CRV of emission per week, representing $266.9K per year obtained with 270k veSDT boost delegated. However, as soon as the delegation is over, the voting power will be back to 0.61x. Proportional protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool) Same as on Curve, the 3CRV fees are distributed to sdCRV stakers. Transferable Asset (sdCRV) When CRV are deposited on Stake DAO, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint sdCRV at 1:1. These sdCRV can be staked for sdCRV-gauge, transferred or sold on the sdCRV-CRV pool on Curve. Additionally, the Stake DAO team communicated that the votes now operate like veCRV. Please note, Llama has not been able to publicly find this announcement beyond this forum thread. Cons Extra counterparty risk (Stake on top of Curve) This solution adds extra smart contracts risks, similar to st-yCRV with additional counterparty risk through reliance on ACI and/or others to provide delegated veSDT support. This veSDT support requires weekly relock and redelegation to avoid impacting the boost. As Aaves CRV continues to grow in line with Aave revenue, additional veSDT delegation will be required to maintain the maximum boost. Llama does not question ACIs dedication to Aave. After the initial committed 1 year period, Aave will receive reduced voting power if an alternative veSDT delegate is not found. High risk asset profile (Depeg risk) The sdCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $3.8M. With the current Aave holdings and liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k sdCRV with a rate of 0.9826:1. Management of the rewards Considering that Aave will vote for pools with no vote incentives have decided on the Curve pools, Aave would not earn part of the yield disclosed on the UI. Moreover, all rewards from vote incentives are sold for SDT and distributed. If Aave is to accumulate a CRV holding over time, the SDT tokens would need to be swapped to CRV. No veBoost (Kept by Stake DAO) Same as Yearn, Stake DAO would keep the veBoost to maximize the yield on their strategies. NAE - aCRV on v3 Liquidity Pools. To vote NAE involves Aave holding all CRV positions in the form of aCRV. All CRV is to be migrated/deposited into Aave v3 on the respective network and held as aCRV. In order to achieve this, CRV must first be listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. The only smart contract exposure is the Aave protocol and this strategy best represents the \"do nothing approach versus either optimizing for governance influence with yield, Option 1), or outright CRV yield, Option 2) Comments. Llama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating active voting power and enabling Aave to determine how to manage the position. We are particularly interested in creating an Aave aToken liquidity pool and explore what can be done to support GHO and staked aTokens when more details emerge around those upgrades. In our opinion, Option 2) has several significant unknowns which can impact the success of the strategy. Next Steps. The proposal with the most YAE votes will be presented as an AIP for voting.

Overview. This proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP) The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don't fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model. The current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal]([link]) passed on Jan 9, 2023. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 7 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL and bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-76]([link]) and [BIP-144]([link]) Only significant changes to the previous proposal are: 1. Co-lead positions changing to Burns as a single lead due to Zen Dragons external commitments. Zen Dragons contributions as a co-lead have been invaluable to the grants programs success to date. Fortunately, he will be remaining on the grants team as a highly valuable committee member. 2. Addition of Steve0xp in place of ZeKraken. ZeKraken stepped down in Q1 with other commitments and Steve0xp has shown immediate commitment and value to the grants committee over the previous 2 months through knowledge as a smart contract dev and creation/publication of marketing materials. As a long standing committee member with vast Balancer and DeFi knowledge generally, ZeKraken will be a welcome contributor in the future if circumstances change. Due to rise in BAL price since previous funding proposal, no funds are requested to top up the treasury (currently 65,469 BAL uncommitted) for 55,719 BAL to future grantees and 9,750 BAL for committee/support. As always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program. Previous Performance. Managing between 16-18 live grantees providing cross-functional support between BLabs, Orb and grantees. Championed co-funding arrangements with Aura Grants (Notional and Sturdy) Two TWAMM implementations, one in Beta (longswap.xyz) and a second due to be live next quarter. Notional Finance adding >$3m TVL from $70k grant. More pools to be launched with Aura co-funding. Funding custom managed pools controller development with novel use cases. (Kassandra, Autonolas) Bringing Yearns yBAL into Balancer ecosystem. Funding development of Xeonus' analytics site. Expanding Balancer docs and SDK. Dedication to transparent approvals process and reporting. Recovered Funds from stale grantees to redistribute to new projects. Domain of Operation. The grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects. The Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below. Grants Committee. The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. One major change is moving from co-leads to a single lead due to external commitments. With this change, the committee remains an equal democracy. While we rely on individuals expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions, no individual has a greater authority on what is approved or not. Burns - Committee Coordination Lead. Zen Dragon - Committee Member/Mentor. Jay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor. John Grant - Committee Member/Mentor. Mike B - Committee Member/Mentor. Steve0xp - Committee Member/Mentor. Xeonus - Committee Member/Mentor. The committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget. The Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees. By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi. Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown. This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period January 1st, 2023 until March 31st, 2023. At the end of this cycle (March 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next quarter budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle. Compensation will continue to be paid out in BAL to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee. Tiers are: Committee Lead - $7,500 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .

Funding - Rewards. Executive Summary. Hello Gnosis community! We would like to realize a prototype for a decentralized, off-chain, encrypted group chat where Ethereum addresses can serve as the receivers identifiers. To achieve this we want to improve and build on top of the [Messaging Layer Security Protocol]([link]) (MLS) and the [p2panda]([link]) protocol. This technology fills a need in the Gnosis community for a generic and encrypted off-chain data layer. This technology fills a need in the Gnosis community for a generic and encrypted off-chain data layer. The group chat will also be a proof of concept and template for future applications serving the Gnosis community using the same infrastructure. Specification. [p2panda]([link]) is a new protocol and ecosystem for building decentralised applications with authenticated and encrypted data which is automatically stored and synced between computers. Some of the building blocks of p2panda are a permission system, conflict-free replicated data types, multi-key identities, data schemas, multi-writer documents, local deletion, sparse replication, dynamic GraphQL queries, hybrid network topologies and more. While p2panda aims at being a low-barrier framework to enter the p2p space without worrying too much about the technical challenges coming with it, we also want to offer a toolbox to build radical applications which work locally, offline and both in the browser and on low-energy devices like a smartphone or embedded computer. Data is encrypted with the help of the MLS protocol providing Double-Ratchet-based group encryption. MLS assures Post-Compromise Security (PCS) and Forward Secrecy (FS) and still stays performant for large groups. While MLS is capable of working in a decentralised environment it hasn't been explicitly specified for it. With p2panda we have all the building blocks to realize MLS in a fully decentralised setting. For all of this to play nicely together, the following implementation steps are planned: Secret Groups. _Secret Groups_ is the data schema that p2panda uses to handle data encryption for groups in a decentralised setting and it builds on MLS as its underlying layer. p2panda already contains a low-level API for MLS that we implemented as a precursor for the more high-level _Secret Groups_ This low-level API supports two basic usage scenarios: Double-Ratchet-based encryption (the MLS default) and a so called \"Long Term Secret\" encryption on top of that. The latter allows group members to still decrypt past data after entering the group, which is practical for building applications like Wikis. Double-Ratchet-based encryption offers Forward Secrecy instead (FS), which can be used for secure chat applications and other use cases where new group members should not access past data. The next step will be building an elegant high-level API that makes this system easily accessible for developers that want to integrate _Secret Groups_ in their applications. This involves additions to our GraphQL API, p2pandas built-in data schemas and replication data format, which are all part of our core protocol specification. Further Links - \"OpenMLS\" MLS implementation in Rust which is used by p2panda: [link] - MLS integration in p2panda: [link] - Draft \"Secret Group\" specification in p2panda: [link] Rust and TypeScript libraries. Developers will use our Rust and TypeScript libraries to integrate p2panda in their applications. To persist MLS group state we will implement interfaces for some known storage backends developers can choose from (SQL, IndexedDB, LocalStorage) To account for forks of diverging group state (due to network fragmentation) we need to extend our persistence system with an additional layer. This layer keeps past group states for a while to be able to decrypt messages from \"forked\" group states. This temporarily weakens Forward Secrecy the more fragmented the group state gets. Further Links - MLS specification (Version 9 February 2023) addressing forked group states: [link] - OpenMLS Rust crate allowing handling past group epochs w. 'max_past_epochs' option: [link] - Diagram: Handling concurrent updates in Secret Groups: [link] - 'p2panda-rs' Rust crate: [link] - 'p2panda-js' npm package: [link] Key Groups. The MLS specification does not have a concept of \"moderators\" or \"administrators\" in a group. Theoretically all members of the group can mutate its state. p2panda _Key Groups_ are a permission layer on top of MLS which allows for decentralised permission handling of multi-writer data. Next to permissions they also enable multi-device identities. As part of this effort we will create an implementation of our specification of the _Key Groups_ system, which will be able to model a permission system on top of any encrypted group. Further Links - Draft \"Key Group\" specification: [link] External Keys. p2panda uses Ed25519 as the Digital Signature Algorithm. To allow other DSAs we need to implement a _handshake_ process where external identity systems such as an Ethereum key can authorise an MLS group member. This will involve adding another data schema to p2panda. Further Links - Diagram: External keys in p2panda: [link] - Schema specification: [link] POC: Group chat in Circles client. As a proof-of-concept (POC) we will integrate p2panda with MLS into an existing Ethereum application in the Gnosis community. Since our team partly consists of the original developers of the Circles ecosystem we want to use the current Circles web client to show how Ethereum addresses (Gnosis Safe contracts) can be used as receiver addresses for an encrypted MLS chat group. Users can associate their Gnosis Safe address (\"Circles profile\") with a p2panda key Users can create and manage groups to communicate with a set of other Safe addresses Users can access their chats from all of their devices simultaneously Further Links - Circles website: [link] - Circles client: [link] Security Audit. The OpenMLS team which partly consists of the IETF standard editors consulted us already with the correct integration of MLS into p2panda. We will continue with this collaboration. To verify our work and gather feedback we want to work with Least Authority for a security audit. - OpenMLS: [link] - Least Authority: [link] Rationale. Scaleable data encryption for large groups in a decentralised network is hard and has always involved a trade-off between UX and security. We believe that MLS is the first [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard]([link]) to tackle some of these challenges. p2p applications of all kinds, for example the Gnosis Safe Apps, will benefit from an off-chain protocol that gives them a distributed, strongly encrypted database stack. One goal of p2pandas protocol design has been enabling both usage from native apps, independent of a stable connection to the internet, and immediate access from a plain web browser, without having to install any additional software. Additionally, p2panda keeps data portable instead of locking it to a specific application or server. Our design works in both federated network topologies and fully decentralised systems, both of which can be configured depending on the needs of the software and the communities that are operating it. Ethereum addresses (EOA and Contract account, for example of a Gnosis Safe) are ideal identifiers for applications like a distributed messaging platform. They are already established in the community, simplify onboarding and enable cross-validation of identities through previous usage of those keys. Protocols with centralised registries like PGP/GPG failed here and we believe that Ethereum addresses that are native to decentralised networks are much more suitable for this task. We want to enable any holder of an Ethereum key to bring their identity and access additional tools for the community.

Team & Organisation. p2panda is a not-for-profit organisation founded in 2021 with the mission to bring an easy to use but radical p2p stack to app developers. We received the NGI Pointer grant in 2021/22 and NGI Assure in 2022/23. The team behind p2panda are experts in p2p, Rust and TypeScript development. The founding members are: - [adz]([link]) has been the core developer next to [isthisa]([link]) developing the first version of the Circles UBI community currency, both of them founded later the [bitspossessed]([link]) developer collective which still maintains the Circles project. - [sandreae]([link]) is a Rust developer with experience across the landscape of offline-first protocols. - [cafca]([link]) is part of the [Decent Patterns]([link]) library team, currently working on the JavaScript SDK of ditto. Conclusion. Secure encryption for large groups is a complex problem which gets even harder in a decentralised setting. With the new [Messaging Layer Security Protocol]([link]) (MLS) and [p2panda]([link]) as the decentralisation layer we want to introduce a solution that can account for a range of community-, threat- and networking models. At the same time we want to provide accessible and well-documented APIs for developers to easily build their solutions on top.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJU2f0oFiSphZAqJGZhbBAIabRB", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954312, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposal is to create a prototype for a decentralized, encrypted group chat using Ethereum addresses as identifiers.

Reduce the current GEAR/WETH liquidity mining program from 6.66m GEAR/month to 3.33m GEAR/month. Utilize the remaining GEAR from the currently approved liquidity mining program until gone, then utilize GEAR from the treasury to extend the program indefinitely (until modified or dictated otherwise by a future proposal) Context. Currently there is 6.8m GEAR left in the [gauge distributor]([link]) rewards contract. Each week approximately 1.67m GEAR is sent to the GEAR/WETH Curve pool from the contract, or approximately 6.66m GEAR/month, meaning the current liquidity mining program would last until mid April. The current spend is about 0.8% of supply per year. This proposal would reduce the spend on GEAR/WETH liquidity to 0.4% of supply per year. [[GIP-36]]([link]) Incentivizing GEAR/ETH liquidity originally began at the end of 2022 and would expire in the end of April, 2023. It approved 3.33m GEAR/month to be used to liquidity mine the GEAR/WETH Curve pool for 4 months. [Cider'd rewards]([link]) also began at that time, with half going to Cider'd participants and [the remainder]([link])being added to the same liquidity mining pool to be distributed over 4 months, resulting in 6.67m GEAR/month of liquidity mining. The current Curve GEAR/WETH pool holds $4.6m of liquidity (at time of writing) with fluctuating convex staking APR around 60%-80%, with 30% APR coming from liquidity mining and the rest coming from miscellaneous veCRV voters. This is on a slight downtrend ([2 weeks ago]([link]) it was 100%) There are a few factors that could increase liquidity in the future: 1. An increase in GEAR/WETH price would increase the effective APR, thus attracting more liquidity. 2. Tokens tend to become less volatile after launch, thus reducing the APR required to subsidize impermanent loss (also LPers can be lazy and happy to remain and collect even at a lower APR given lack of better percieved opportunities) There are a few factors that could decrease liquidity in the future: 1. This proposal! It would reduce effective APR from 60-80% down to 45-65%, 2. As a result of this proposal, or in general, veCRV voters could stop voting for GEAR/WETH. 3. A decrease in the GEAR/WETH price would decrease the effective APR, thus potentially causing some liquidity to leave. For reference, if all veCRV voters left and this proposal were also enacted, and APR was kept constant, the pool size would reduce to ~$1m. However, GEAR has also had listings on centralized exchanges - currently the Curve pool makes up only 20% of the volume of GEAR trading, with CEXs making up almost the entirety of the rest of the volume. Therefore, with with a theoretical worst-case scenario still being a minimally viable pool size, at about 5-10% of circulating supply. Note that much of this proposal is subjective - the main point being justifying a 50% decrease in liquidity mining rewards, rather than trying to determine the ideal minimum amount of rewards (which is also subjective, and would likely require analysis of what is typically done with GEAR rewards from the diesel lending pools) Voting. 1. FOR - modify GEAR/WETH liquidity mining program to 3.33m GEAR/month indefinitely. 2. AGAINST - do not change liquidity mining program (set to expire mid-April)\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJUOtSt9IaeLuijHWK5TwGGRbKg", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954312, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests reducing the current GEAR/WETH liquidity mining program from 6.66 million GEAR per month to 3.33 million GEAR per month.

Gotchi ID: 8977. Funding Request: 131,400 USD. Development time: 4-6 months. Quorum requirement: 20% (9M) Vote Duration: 7 days. Discourse thread: [link] Introduction: The Strategotchi team are seeking a grant to complete the design and development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version. The team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability. Introductory post + litepaper: [link] Longterm Value: Additionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption. A Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game. Our game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore. It features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference. Guild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution: [link] Token Sinks: The game will provide a sink for native tokens through \"Ranked Mode buy-ins in GHST and/or alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables. Guild vs Guild: Along with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies. Gotchichain: With the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience. This is why PC sees the potential for Strategotchi to launch with heavy support in Gotchichains launch window. Budget: We are seeking 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) paid in 2 installments.

Total: 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) Original budget: 87.6k GHST ($1.5/GHST) Roadmap + Budget: [link] Conclusion: We believe this project has the potential to attract a new player base and expose the Aavegotchi IP to a new audience of strategy game enthusiasts, aligning it with the 2023 roadmap set out by PC, focusing on gaming and player growth. It also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition. As of today, I have achieved a verbal understanding with PC to have a limited licensing agreement extended to this project. Such a license will move into drafting and signatures only after the passage of this Sigprop. The agreement grants PC 20% of the revenue, and includes their support with smart contract development. (The remaining 80% is to be split evenly between player rewards and the DAO.) Its important to emphasize that this grant is specifically for the digital version of the game, although plans for an official PC physical version are already being discussed. From my talks with the PC team, they are very enthusiastic about the idea and already have multiple manufacturing and distribution leads for the tabletop physical. We are super excited and highly driven to emark on this ebic project, frens.

Associated unlock: $57,022. Abstract. NFTs have evolved from being simple registries on blockchains to various types based on the case. The NFT market is expected to reach more than $232 billion by 2031. We are looking to provide the community with an intuitive user experience for creating, collecting, and selling NFTs while empowering the user with the best-in-class power tools to make the best decision in every step of the journey. The Marketplace will be unique from competitors by designing a cutting-edge NFT aggregator marketplace with optimized UI/UX to attract NFT/crypto traders to onboard to the platform and take action. Moreover, the 1inch community will benefit as the Marketplace will provide users with empowering analytics & browsing tools and educational content, for guiding and educating users. We would like to request the 1inchDAO a total of $387,022 for creating an MVP of the NFT marketplace. Motivation. 1inch is currently the leading decentralized aggregator and has earned a reputation for providing the best prices on token swaps. With the boom in the NFT market, there is a new product segment which 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on - the NFT aggregator marketplace. Overall, the rise of the NFT market can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the increasing adoption of blockchain technology, the growth of the digital art market, and the availability of online marketplaces that facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs. Looking at the market potential we can see that even throughout the current bear market the volume of transactions is still growing and specifically the aggregated marketplaces (e.g. Gem and Genie) are taking leading market share. ![image]([link]) ![image]([link]) Moreover, looking at current trends we can see that Dec 2022 is showing an improvement in total sales of NFT with market volume of nearly $2B. ![image]([link]) By implementing this proposal, 1inchDAO will expand its services and revenue channels, onboard new users to 1inch network, and add additional utilities to 1inch token. Specification. The proposed marketplace will have the following features Connect Wallet 1inch wallet integration (1inch Token) MetaMask integration (Ethereum, Binance, Polygon) NFT Aggregate API Integration NFT aggregation from Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon marketplaces Buy Now Users can purchase NFTs with any token in one transaction on 1inch marketplace using the 1inch wallet Bids Users can place bids for the tokens based on their interests. They will enter the details such as the bid amount, and wallet. These bids will be stored on smart contracts and sent to the creators or sellers. Sellers will be able to accept bids from the users based on the amount and preferences. Based on the bids, sellers can sell the tokens on the platform. Once the seller accepts the bid, the amount from the buyers wallet will be transferred to the sellers wallet. The transactions and ownership details will be recorded on the blockchain. Search/Filters Advance search engine with user recommendations based on NFT collection volume and spam/fake collection check _(e.g., When you type the name of the collection, it gives you results that are filtered by daily volume, highest volume on top, and gives priority to the collections that have verified checkmark)_ Rarity rankings, sort by rarity, sort by specific traits, sort by price My Watchlist Create custom feeds to watch your favorite collections Whale/Influencers wallets watchlists/alerts Wallets leaderboard Get instant alerts sent to your browser, Telegram, or Discord NFT Calendar Upcoming drops / Free mints / Stealth mints / Blockchain real-time scan Add any collection with token address Suggested NFT AI powered \"Matching game or \"You may also like suggestions for NFT Create a single NFT The creators must also choose on what network (Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon) they want to create their NFT Launchpad Create and launch NFT collections (Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon) Share Users will be able to share the collectible with their social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram Basic Analytics Get live floor prices, volume, and sales data on any collection, wallet, or mint Deep dive into sales history, floor price, volume, and trends.

Revenue from NFT Marketplace: All the service fees for transactions and listing of the NFT Marketplace during the MVP phase will go to 1inchDAO treasury. Additional discussion about revenue allocation as the NFT Marketplace will evolve from the MVP phase will be discussed in due time Receiving address for funds distribution eth: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Potential Revenue channels (conservative projection) and yearly estimated revenue. ![image]([link]) Additional benefits to the 1inch network. 1. Increase in 1inch user base. 2. Increase in of wallet downloads. 3. Footprint in the NFT space. Rationale. The rationale for this proposal is in two folds. First, creating a new revenue channel for 1inch by joining the NFT market which presents a market cap of $11.3 billion and with a predicted compound annual growth rate of 33.7% in the following eight years NFT space will see its total market cap climb to $231 billion by 2030. Second, with 1inch protocols and network we can offer the users the best UX for trading NFTs at the lowest transaction cost which will position 1inch at the top tier for NFT trading. This proposal aims to develop a leading NFT aggregator marketplace with the best-in-class power tools and analytical and educational features. Competitors and business analysis have been performed to define key features of the proposed 1inch NFT marketplace. Based on research, the business gaps in the NFT marketplace field are: 1. Most marketplaces are not focused on giving users intuitive analytical tools to make data-driven decisions. 2. There are several websites for NFT analysis. Most of them have free tools and paid tools. 3. Users are forced to pay a monthly fee to use power tools or switch between different websites to perform analysis. 4. Most marketplaces provide a basic browsing experience. 5. Most competitors offer users minimal education and guidance. The key features that will place 1inch NFT Marketplace at the leading position are: 1. Buy now  users can use ANY token to purchase NFTs in one transaction on the 1inch marketplace. 2. Unique and intuitive UX/UI aligned with 1inch design brand. 3. Educational/ empowering tools to help users make the right decision. 4. Developing an eCommerce community around the marketplace to drive traffic and increase the 1inch user base. Considerations. The proposed NFT marketplace is going to have three levels of security: server, application, and smart contract. SERVER SECURITY: - CIS: CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems and data against cyberattacks. - PCI DSS: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of users personal information. - AWS BEST PRACTICES: This is a standard set of compliances provided by AWS for best security practices. APPLICATION SECURITY: - User Keys storage is encrypted. Thus, avoiding exposable data. - Use of SSL to prevent data injection. - CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) handling. - XSS (Cross Site Scripting) - CAPTCHA (if needed) - Avoiding Direct DOM access. - SSR (Server-side rendering) - SNYK Package (Used for best practices to monitor vulnerabilities) SMART CONTRACT SECURITY: - SLITHER TEST: Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses. - CHAI TESTING FRAMEWORK. - OPENZEPPELIN TEST HELPDESK. - DEVELOPMENT & TESTING USING HARDHAT. - VULNERABILITY TESTS USING ECHIDNA FUSSY TEST TOOL. - SECURITY ANALYSIS USING MYTHRIL AUDIT TOOL. - REENTRANCY ATTACK PREVENTION USING OPENZEPPELIN LOG AUDIT. Additionally, CERTIK audit services will be used for both smart contract audit and application audit. Vendor support: Dev services will be outsourced to Blockchain App Factory (BAF) Blockchain App Factory (BAF) will take lead on the development execution of the proposed NFT marketplace with alignment with 1inch architecture and BE team. BAF has been a Web3 industry leader for years with a team of more than 500 employees, including 100+ experienced blockchain developers. They have launched over 200 innovative Web3 business applications for clients across the globe.

There are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always. After discussions with other leaders in the ecosystem in the wake of [BIP-149]([link])s failure to pass it was decided that Maxis should step into the role of project management. This is in addition to Maxis assuming the role of partnerships & business development in Q4. Despite having significantly more responsibilities, we are not raising net compensation, but we are re-assessing how each Maxi is compensated. Please see the following table for monthly salary specifics. Some Maxis have opted to take some or all of their compensation in liquid BAL for various reasons. While my salary is increasing to reflect the increased importance of Maxis in the ecosystem I will continue to lock 100% and max re-lock my previous salaries. This is to ensure I have skin in the game and remain highly motivated to ensure Maxis execute at a high level in all of our areas of operation. I'll point out that net USD compensation is decreasing by nearly 3% while net BAL compensation is decreasing 20% to reflect a higher BAL price compared to last quarter. Additionally, we are requesting an allocation of 1500 BAL to be used for 3rd party dev bounties. This will be led by Tritium as we look to expand the development capacity of Maxis and automate more of our routine tasks. We will present a detailed accounting of how these 1500 BAL are spent in our monthly updates and the next funding proposal. Finally, instead of asking for BAL for gas expenses we'll instead ask for 5 ETH from the treasury. We will also continue the 5000 BAL per month for Coordinape. --- Service Provider Name: Balancer Maxis Leader(s): Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium. Pledge to abide by the DAOs [Code of Conduct]([link]) (or link to your own): Yes Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines]([link]): Yes Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics: As Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocols future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer. Our Q2 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance for the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group. Reading the previous [Q1 funding post]([link]) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for [January]([link]), [February]([link]), and March. Multisig Management Linear (boosted) pool settings Swap fee and amplification adjustments Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL Adding new reward tokens to gauges Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig. These are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist  they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people. Governance We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot. Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics Several of us are [delegates]([link]) Advise projects on Balancers governance process Manage admin of the Governance Forum We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group. During Q1 Balancer governance passed [BIP-163]([link]) which represented a pivotal step forward in decentralization of the governance process. Anyone with at least 200k veBAL can now post proposals to snapshot. This BIP also introduced a new process for verifying mutlisig payloads for BIPs that require on-chain execution. Maxis fill the role of \"verifier of last resort to ensure Balancer governance can continue to operate, though anyone can submit a multisig payload and/or verify its accuracy. Partnerships We manage Balancers Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions We often deploy new pools for other projects Whitelisting and maintaining token lists We help with UI testing for Balancer Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancers technology, primarily in the DeFi realm Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations. Maxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc) Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months despite the various issues we've faced like the read only reentrancy bug and the Euler hack. Community We manage a monthly Coordinape circle, open to all DAO contributors Onboarding framework for new contributors Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. By adopting an easy and seamless onboarding framework, every applicant is being reached through discovery calls and monthly follow-ups. We help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer. By keeping contributors engaged, we aim to retain talents in the Balancer ecosystem as Ballers, Grantees or shaping their own Service Provider. Project Management Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight Be the driving force behind the ecosystems top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties. Maxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish. Record Keeping We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded. Length of Engagement & Budget: 3 months. Budget of 8,550 BAL per month for salaries, of which 60% will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 5,000 BAL for Coordinape, a quarterly allocation of. 1500 BAL for dev bounties, and a quarterly allocation of 5 ETH for gas expenses. Total for 3 month engagement: 42,150 BAL+ 5 ETH. Impact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~4.4M BAL.

This proposal is an Addendum to [SCP-119] and is in response to the announcement of @Diggy stepping down from the role of Product Workstream Leader and moving on from the DAO. The goal of this addendum is to maintain stability, velocity and success in the Product Workstream through the currently approved timeline and provide support, structure and accountability until a full-time Product Leader can be identified, proposed, and voted in. Summary: In accordance with SCP-119, the Product Workstream has had their budget approved through June 15th. With @Diggy stepping down before the end of that timeline, this proposal nominates @Tyler | ShapeShift to become the interim workstream leader of the Product Workstream until a new leader is found as well as promotes @PTT from his roles in both Operations and Product to the new full time role in the Product Workstream under the new title Project Manager & Product Analyst' Motivation: With @Diggy moving on before the end of the current Product Workstream Proposal, there are areas of responsibility that will be left open to fill in: admin, meeting leading and organization, task management, KPI and project tracking/reporting, among other countless Workstream Leader responsibilities. Tyler has proven capable of supporting workstreams outside of Operations in [SCP-99] in stepping into an Interim Workstream Leader role with the Marketing Workstream until another Workstream leader was identified and proposed. This proposal provides temporary assurance of stability and continued success in the goals outlined through the length of [SCP-119] and maintains the structure of the Workstream for the remaining contributors and greater DAO until a proper future Workstream Leader is established. Finding a replacement for the interim leader will be a top priority, and a committee or group of advisors can be formed to help field candidates, hold interviews, and find a new full-time Workstream Leader. Having til June 15 to find the right future workstream leader can provide more assurances to the DAO that we have adequate time to find the perfect fit. If a new Workstream Leader is not selected by the end of the new proposed term limit, a new proposal will be required for renewal of the stream and Interim Workstream Leader. Specification. This proposal addendum identifies Tyler | ShapeShift as the new Interim Product Workstream Leader. Tyler will assume all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Product Workstream while continuing his obligations as the Operations Workstream leader, splitting focus and time. No additional compensation is requested. Under this proposal, Tyler will communicate and advise actively with the current Product Workstream Contributors and provide support and guidance in: Arranging phase 2 strategy talks, and getting the Phase 2 roadmap proposal posted to the forum and moved through governance. Workstream contributor payments made through Colony. Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week. Product/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint. Draft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, and continuing the iterative process to prepare a feature for development. Hosting and Leading Spec breakdowns between Product and Engineering. Scheduling the Osmosis retro and when to prioritize the next phase. Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s. Hoff, whos currently on retainer to make updates to shapeshift.com on an as needed basis will temporarily report in to Beard on a weekly basis to review needs, design work, etc. Additionally under this proposal, @PTT will be moving his focuses and DAO responsibilities to be more aligned with a promotion and title change to a full time Product Workstream contributor with the new title, Project Manager & Product Analyst. Under his new title and role, @PTT will find new and more detailed responsibilities in: Continuing to track results from Phase 1 strategy data and build forecasts based on specific ShapeShift user data to inform future features and integrations. Tracking and reporting on Workstream goals and KPIs. Collaborating with Beard on getting data from Mix Panel and helping present during Product Office Hours and AllFox meetings. Assist with the creation and completion of Product specs. Maintain the Partnership flow and assist with the ShapeShift DAO Grant Committee. Adhoc Product related requests from other DAO Workstreams. Operations lost an additional member of the current Operations Workstream at the end of March with @WesleyGraves leaving his contributor role. There is a strong acknowledgement that Tylers interim position and @PTTs new full time role are only made possible by the remaining Operations Workstream contributors, @Tshifty and @MBMaria stepping up to take on new delegated tasks and responsibilities. As there are 2 Operations Assistant roles being absorbed in the remaining Operations Workstream, @Tshifty and @MBMaria will both be receiving a promotion from Operations Assistant to Operations Coordinator. This proposal expedites a search for a new Product Workstream leader to be identified and integrated, and upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream. Budget. Both the Product and Operations Workstreams will see decreases in their monthly spend if this proposal passes.

Author: TokenLogic @MatthewGraham. Dated: 2023-03-18. --- Simple Summary. TokenLogic presents an opportunity to help kick start the migration from v2 to v3 by capitalising on the favourable conditions presented by the imminent multi-token liquidity mining program on the Polygon v3 market. Abstract. On Polygon, there are two Aave deployments in production and the majority of the liquidity is deposited into the obsolete v2 deployment. With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and several communities about to distribute rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3. With SD, LDO, stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be flowing across the v3 deployment imminently, Aave is presented with an incredibly unique set of conditions that offer an ideal opportunity for further encouraging the onboarding of users onto the v3 deployment. The lion share of TVL on Polygon v2 could be migrated with simple changes presented within. This publication provides initial parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation. Users with debt positions are encouraged to migrate to reduce borrowing costs and users with deposits are encouraged to migrate to receive a higher deposit rate. This initiative is open for discussion and will be changed to reflect the evolving discussion in the comments section below. The key consideration here is the oversized upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign. Motivation. In recent months, Llamas has coordinated across several teams to bring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and rewards to the Polygon v3 deployment. Stader Labs is currently distributing SD rewards, with Lido DAO and Polygon Foundation expected to commence distributing LDO, MaticX and stMATIC rewards in the very near future. Next week, cough. Normally, with rewards being distributed across the Aave v3 deployment, usage and therefore deposit rates are expected to increase. However, on this occasion, incentives are not expected to be applied to stable coin deposits and the higher deposit rate on stable coins will need to be demand driven. Currently, Aave v2 offers higher deposit rates and higher borrowing rates on 2 of 3 major stable coins. Table 1 below compares the three main stable coins. !([link]]) For stable coin deposit rates to increase on v3, the liquidity mining will be reliant on wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX deposits being used as collateral to borrow stable coins. With this approach to liquidity mining, some demand for borrowing stable coins is expected on v3, but it is not certain and it creates the need for further action from the Aave community to encourage migration. This proposed upgrade, coinciding with the lucrative incentive campaign on v3, is intended to further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by reducing the v2 deployments capital efficiency. V2 will remain very much functional and supportive of communities to migrate to v3 on their timeline. For reserves where the utilization is less than the Uoptimal value, this proposal seeks to update the Uoptimal parameter to be the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal value. This will lead to higher borrowing costs, estimated to be around 35% higher (borrow interest 2.37% to 2.96%) on average for the main stable coins, and if the RF is not adjusted, will lead to higher deposit rates. By increasing the RF, from 10% to around 30%, the additional interest that would have been received by depositors will be redirected to Aaves Collector Contract. As a result, deposit rates will not meaningfully change on v2 and borrow rates increase. If/when the liquidity mining on v3 leads to higher borrowing cost, if no action is taken on v2, v2 will offer the lowest borrowing rates. For assets like wETH, BTC and AAVE being used as collateral to borrow stable coins there will be no incentive to migrate to v3. By increasing borrowing rates on v2, the v3 deployment will remain more competitive when utilization on comparable reserves are similar, see Table 2. In fact, the v3 deployment can have higher utilization and still offer a lower cost of capital which gives v3 a competitive advantage over v2, see Table 3. !([link]]) If just the RF was increased on v2, then deposit rates on v2 would reduce and borrowing which is already slightly more expensive relative to v3 would remain unchanged, thus providing no additional incentive for borrowers to migrate. This is especially true for those that have deposited wMATIC, wETH or wBTC and borrowed stable coins. Thus the need to increase borrowing costs on v2 relative to v3. By decreasing the Uoptimal value, the capital efficiency of the reserves is reduced and with each redemption/deposit (removal of liquidity) the borrowing rate will be more sensitive as the gradient of the first portion of the interest rate curve is slightly steeper. Each larger redemption, withdrawal of liquidity, will cause borrow rates to increase that bit more than otherwise which continues to encourage migration over time. To continually adjust the Uoptimal lower would be a rather aggressive approach towards migrating users. Until the timeline around when Chainlink intends to begin charging for oracles, future changes may focus on reducing the deposit rate by adjusting the RF over time. For frozen assets, adjusting the RF appears to be the most effective way forward as it was shown to be successful when applied to FEI. As rewards being distributed on Aave v3 are finite (bear market) and for a limited amount of time (3 months), the time to initiate the migration from v2 to v3 is now. With any luck, the rewards will lead to a lot of funds migrating and this proposal then ensures v2 offers higher borrow costs relative to v3 which further encourages migration. There is a risk here that the borrow cost increase proposed in this proposal is too subtle. However, this is not intended to be a mass migration push proposal but instead a smaller change that compliments the v3 liquidity mining program to Aave benefit. Follow up proposals can further adjust Upotimal values once utilization on reserves like USDT have reverted back to more normal conditions. Uoptimal Parameter. This publication splits the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value. Slope 2 Parameter. By reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Slope 2 changes from 75% to 150% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60% Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient. !([link]]) Reserve Factor. As a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased. This redirects interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors. The table in the Specification section outlines how each RF is adjusted to keep the deposit rate mostly unchanged despite the higher borrow rates. Due to abnormally high USDT usage, 84.51% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins. Specification. Table 4 below presents the current asset configuration on Polygon v2. !([link]]) Based upon the methodology presented above, Table 5 details the parameter changes. !([link]]) Do note, the parameters to be changed have been rounded to nearest whole number and no Uoptimal was increased. Pior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations. Next Steps. Community discussion, whereby any service provider or contributor can elect to work with the author on the implementation. The main intent here is for Aave to make the most of the rewards distribution programs that are about to add to Stader Labs existing reward program. It would be greatly appreciated if a risk service provider could confirm the above will not adversely affect users, which hopefully will resonate with delegates within the community. The key with this proposal is time, as rewards on v3 will last only a finite amount of time. The author believes the changes presented here within, thought of as a one-off, or opportunistic, will lead to the migration of the majority of most liquidity. The liquidity mining campaign coordinated by Llama should be capitalized upon. Disclosoure. TokenLogic is publishing this proposal as the scope falls outside of Llamas core role within the Aave ecosystem, that said, at TokenLogic we are more than happy for any contributor to progress this proposal.

No plans for further core or alloy release in this period.  Goal is for content to accrue value to native assets (gotchis, wearables)  Backgrounds, wearable skins, evolving pets and a new BRS-modifying slot will be tabled for further technical development. The Forge Team will prevent the most viable and community-favored project(s) for the next Forge installment.  Compensation is denominated in USD instead of GHST for a total of $161,825 for the Forge Team and a 10,000 GHST bounty budget. The Aavegotchi Forge Team proposes a 3 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing and improve features on the Aavegotchi protocol and User Interface. Over this three-month period, we plan to \"stick the landing for the Forge, add additional User Interface work w/ an integrated dressing room, and outline potential new features that can be pursued by the Forge Team or other design teams. A contracted three-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 generated >$256,000 in total sales. We anticipate we will be able to continue to generate revenue without inflating cores or alloy and aim for budget neutrality or better while delivering new content, advancing the protocol, improving user experience, and providing value to native assets. Forge Team Roadmap:  Geodes: Regardless of this proposal, the Forge team will debut the minimal viable Geode ASAP with function to obtain the 400 legendary Forge set schematics. As part of this proposal, the Forge Team will develop additional schematics for some of the unmatched cores from the Forge Launch auction. Plan to reload the prize pool by the end of April, ideally with multi-tier rarity functionality.  Review and complete the technical design and airdrop \"Respec Potions.  UI Upgrade: Integrate the \"Dressing Room to the main Aavegotchi website. Create a dress-up and buy now option with new art, new NPC, and Aavegotchi aesthetic. Additionally, we will focus on overall UI/UX improvement with the goal of maximally educating users on protocol assets.  Schematic pipeline  Will operationalize new schematic creation with predictable schematic releases, randomized/fair trait selection, intentional approach to avoid power creep, and maximally assist in translating new wearables to Gotchiverse functionality.  Updates to wearables.report (market data reporting) site to account for new wearables mechanics:  Add a dashboard of metrics related to The Forge (include reporting on two new mechanics developed by The Forge team)  Update existing metrics to account for changes in supply related to forging.  UI/UX improvements (mostly navigation related to accommodate additional content, with some minor aesthetic updates.  Back-end code improvements to allow for modularity and expandability in the future. Future Project Outlines  Forge Team to investigate and prepare potential proposals for the following:  Outline and potentially implement the transition from FRENS to GLTR for raffle tickets.  New/Custom backgrounds  Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds and/or obtain Forge Team/Pixelcraft designed backgrounds.  Wearable skins/non-BRS-modifying wearables  Continue aesthetics focus by creating a path for wearable skins w/ goal to maximize community-created content.  New BRS-modifying slot  Will be tabled for further economic and technical development for presentation to the DAO in Q3 2023.  Evolving pets/Upgradeable wearables  Tabled for further technical development and separate proposal for the DAO, though it still may be implemented by the Forge Team during the 3-month period or beyond. Forge Team Stipend: For this work, diddly will be hired on as a full-time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February-March 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 4 month total stipend vs 3 months for the rest of the team. The three other roles will be part time ~20 hours/week. The 10,000 GHST bounty budget is to maximize external contributions and facilitate open contributions as much as possible. Execution Details:  Three disbursements in DAI from the DAO Treasury Wallet to the Forge Team Wallet which will be specified in the core proposal: o $61,825 upon passage of core proposal. o $50,000 30 days after passage of core proposal. o $50,000 60 days after passage of core proposal. In summary, we are requesting compensation for a dedicated 3-month period to form a devoted, highly skilled and proven team to continue developing the protocol. We strongly believe we will create more value than our asking cost as demonstrated by our previous success.

This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch DAO governance process with the following changes: Remove st1INCH(v1) voting and delegation strategies from the 1inch Snapshot space. Change the st1INCH(v2) voting and delegation strategy to use Unicorn Power instead of token balance. Replace the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy with a strategy that emulates the power decay of UnicornPower  i.e., fully vested, and unclaimed, v1INCH, will have greatly diminished voting power. v1INCH that is at the beginning of its vesting contract has full 1:1 voting parity with st1INCH that is at the beginning of a 2-year lock. Increase the Snapshot proposal creation requirement to require 100,000 Voting Weight (currenlty 25,000) Abstract. If passed, this proposal will modify the 1inch Network governance process to better reflect staking changes made alongside Fusion mode: By removing st1INCH(v1) for the governance process, 1inch Network will fully complete the transition to the new staking contracts. By using Unicorn Power to calculate Voting Weight, instead of token balances, the 1inch DAO governance process is better aligned with the revamped 1INCH staking mechanics. By greatly reducing the voting power of fully vested v1INCH, the DAO will ensure that only those who have a longterm stake in the protocol will be able to make decisions that control 1inch Network. By increasing the proposal creation requirement, we can ensure that proposals which hit the final Snapshot vote already have a non-trivial level of support. Motivation With the passing of [[1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods]([link]) in December, 2022, the DAO began the transition away from the legacy staking contracts. [[1IP-14] Update 1inch DAO Voting Process to Include st1INCH(v2)]([link]) put the infrastructure in place to allow the new st1INCH to participate in governance. This proposal marks the full deprecation of st1INCH(v1) as its only remaining utility has been voting on Snapshot proposals. If st1INCH(v1) is never removed from the voting system, it will have an unfair advantage compared to st1INCH(v2) as the latters power diminishes over time. There is currently over 10 times more st1INCH(v2) staked than st1INCH(v1)  this shows that there has been enough time for all active participants to migrate. Specification. v1INCH. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 token which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors, and core contributors. Redeeming fully-vested v1INCH for the underlying 1INCH is a manual action that must be taken by the holder. Currently, all v1INCH, no matter where it is along its vesting contract, has a flat 20% weighting compared to st1INCH. This proposal calls for a treatment of v1INCH similarly to that of st1INCH(v2)  v1INCH will have more voting power if there is more time remaining on the vesting schedule (with a 2-year maximum) Here is a breakdown of how the voting weight will change according to the unlock schedule: 1-year cliff to full unlock: 22% voting power 1.5-year cliff to full unlock: 47% voting power 2-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power 3-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power 4-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power Example 1 Address: [hexadecimals] v1INCH balance: 37.5M (only 12.5M is locked until June, everything else is fully vested and claimable) VotingPower: Current scheme = 7.5M votes. New scheme = 1.73M votes Example 2 Address: [hexadecimals] v1INCH balance: 250K VotingPower: Current scheme = 50K votes. New scheme = 17K votes Example 3 Address: [hexadecimals] v1INCH balance: 8.57M (everything is locked) VotingPower: Current scheme = 1.71M votes. New scheme = 2.49M votes Example 4 Address: [hexadecimals] v1INCH balance: 500K VotingPower: Current scheme = 100K votes. New scheme = 276K votes. Snapshot. The [1inch Network Snapshot space]([link]), and the[1inch DAO Fast-Track Signaling Subspace]([link]), will be updated with the following changes: Remove st1INCH (v1) voting and delegation strategies Replace existing st1INCH(v2) strategy with one that uses 'Unicorn Power' instead 'erc20-balance-of' Remove the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy Add a new voting-power-weighted strategy for v1INCH using this contract: [VestedVotingPower | Address [hexadecimals] | Etherscan]([link]) This contract gives onchain mapping for the appropriate vesting contract of each v1INCH holder. This is an onchain expression of the logic described in the previous section. Change the proposal validation strategy to require 100,000 Voting Weight when creating a new proposal. Token Contracts v1INCH: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) st1INCH (v2): [[hexadecimals]]([link]) st1INCH (legacy): [[hexadecimals]]([link]) Rationale. Onchain mapping of vesting contracts to each v1INCH holder was a prerequisite for this proposal as there was no other way of determining if a holders v1INCH tokens were fully unvested, partially vested, or fully vested. The 1inch core contributors have deployed the VestedVotingPower smart contract that does this mapping. It is important to note that st1INCH(v1) holders will still be able to unstake their 1INCH at any point in the future. Considerations. This proposal will have no cost to the 1inch DAO Treasury. As opposed to st1INCH(v2), st1INCH(v1) does not require a timelock to participate in governance  a bad actor could use this lack of a time-commitment to abuse the 1inch goverance system. This proposal will prevent that as all votes will only be cast by timelocked tokens. Once passed, the [reality.eth proposal acceptance criteria]([link]), and the [1inch DAO governance documentation]([link]), will need to be updated to reflect the change to v1INCH voting weight and the proposal validation strategy.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJljSHyr6o0m5dZi2wKFfS0FlJv", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954329, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal aims to change the governance process of the 1inch Network by removing the voting and delegation strategies for st1INCH(v1) and replacing them with a strategy using Unicorn Power.

Silo Finance has a large amount of POL in Balancer, earning incentives that are recycled through voting incentives for AURA and BAL holders to further bolster the pool liquidity. Silo Finance continues to increase its voting incentives over time as protocol revenue increases and is committed to support the Balancer ecosystem long-term. Silo Finance is a longtime partner of the Balancer DAO. Silo Finance core contributors have allocated roughly $1.4M~ of personal liquidity to the SILO/ETH 80:20 pool to help expand the governance base of SiloDAO. References/Useful Links: Silo Website: [link] Dev Docs: [link] Silopedia: [link] Twitter: [link] Forum: [link] Snapshot: [link] Tally: [link] 80/20 SILO ETH Pool: [link] 50/50 SILO ETH Pool: [link] Silo Token Address: [link] Defillama: [link] Protocol Description How does Silo Finance work? Silo Finance is a lending market that allows users to lend and borrow any asset in a risk-isolated way through the use of bridge assets. Essentially, the protocol creates an individual lending market (or silo') for each token asset and connects all markets via bridge assets that serve as a protocol-wide accepted collateral. This design creates a security benefit where an exploit taking place in one market doesn't spread to other markets like it is the case in traditional DeFi lending markets. Silo Finance Facts. - Protocol is not upgradable (contracts are battle-tested since Aug. 2022) - Non-custodial: Neither DAO or core team can ever take custody of user funds. - No multi-sigs: DAO controls limited admin functions. [link] State of $SILO liquidity Our two largest liquidity pools are Balancer 80:20 SILO-ETH and 50:50 SILO-ETH pools with total TVL ~ $2.2M. We conduct regular buybacks of $SILO using SiloDAOs revenue directly from our balancer pools, increasing Balancers fee revenue. Additionally, we use part of revenues to increase our voting incentives to BAL and AURA holders Motivation An 80:20 pool confers lower IL exposure to LPs, allowing users to maintain greater upside exposure to the base asset. The upcoming veSILO tokenomics upgrade is designed around a locked version of 80:20 SILO-ETH BPT, similar to veBAL. Having a whitelisted gauge will provide greater incentives for $SILO holders to lock tokens which will allow additional locked TVL to flow to Balancer. Specifications Governance: Silo Finance is operated as a DAO and governance decisions are completely decentralized. SiloDAO is a Cayman Foundation operating under the name of Silo Labs. Token holders create proposals, on-chain and on Snapshot, to manage funds and affect changes to markets such as replacing oracles, updating interest model settings, etc. Oracles: Silos lending markets currently use Uniswap v3, Balancer v2 and Chainlink oracles in order to read asset prices. This is required to gauge lending parameters such as LTV and Health Factors to allow liquidation of undercollateralized positions. We also have some custom Chainlink oracle implementations for assets with things like a rebasing index such as gOHM and wstETH. Users however are only exposed to the oracles that their particular market uses. Audits & Formal Verification: Our audit reports from ABDK and Quantstamp as well as a Certora Formal Verification Report can be found here [link] Centralization vectors: No, token holders are the only ones with any sort of control over the protocol but even then they are limited to only being able to update certain things like oracles, bridge assets, interest rates, LTV/LT settings, and protocol fees. Any changes made are also locked behind a TimeLock Controller, allowing users ample time to withdraw should they not agree with the aforementioned changes. Market History: $SILO price had been seeing a lot of fluctuations given its limited DEX liquidity. We have been seeing positive price action and volume as of late as liquidity increased. Historically, the one sharp drop in token price happened as a result of the largest token holder then - large fund- going underwater in the aftermath of Terra collapse. Value: Balancer has long been SILOs liquidity hub and our 80:20 SILO:ETH Balancer pool will continue to be our primary source of liquidity for $SILO on Ethereum.

We summarize the details of phase 1, and go over an overview of Starknet today. We are here to answer any questions the community has before beginning the official vote for the temperature check of Aave V3 deployment on Starknet, following the BGD framework for new network deployments. Aave on Starknet, present and future: The Aave integration with Starknet has originally been planned in two phases. Phase 1 was aimed to be a limited effort to introduce Starknet to the Aave community. The scope of phase 1 was building a bridge for aTokens between Ethereum to Starknet. Following the successful completion of phase 1, we are now ready to propose a temperature check for the implementation of phase 2: the full deployment of the Aave protocol on Starknet. The Aave community has previously voted with an overwhelming majority in favor of phase 1, and we hope to get similar support to continue developing Aave on Starknet. This proposal is submitted on behalf of Starkware and the Starknet community, to get a temperature check for the full deployment of the Aave V3 protocol on Starknet, following a positive signal. New Chain, New Opportunities: Starknet has been live for just over a year and already sees an astounding rate of new developers and projects building on it. This rate is only expected to rise with the upcoming upgrades to Starknet. There are a few major milestones planned for the near future of Starknet that will bring more scale, cheaper transactions, and a much better development experience. Being a new validity rollup, Starknet supports features that can directly benefit Aave suppliers and borrowers. Starknet natively supports Account Abstraction, allowing wallets to improve the user experience. By deploying on Starknet, the Aave ecosystem immediately benefits from the advanced features afforded by the broader Starknet ecosystem. Starknet has additional benefits, such as efficient liquidity provision. This is a result of Starknet being a validity rollup, where proofs of the entire state of Starknet are validated on Ethereum several times per day. Once a validity proof is verified, all state changes on Starknet and all messages passed between Starknet and Ethereum are valid and final. Starknet users can thus quickly and securely move funds between Starknet and Ethereum, without the need for a long waiting period, and without losing out on slippage to bridges and liquidity providers. The Starknet Ecosystem is growing: Starknet is quickly integrating with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Maker has implemented a DAI bridge from Ethereum to Starknet and are currently working on a full implementation of their protocol on Starknet. Nethermind is working with ENS and starknet.id to support interoperability. Chainlink have recently announced they will be deploying to Starknet. Chainlink contracts are already live on Starknet goerli testnet. Starknet is scaling: Starknet is on a mission to scale beyond what is currently possible on Ethereum or any other Rollup. There are several efforts currently underway to make Starknet handle more demand and become cheaper to use: LambdaClass is reimplementing the Cario virtual machine in Rust, The Starknet sequencer is being reimplemented in Rust, and proving is made better by utilizing recursive proofs. As a result, transactions on Starknet, which are already 10x cheaper than Ethereum, are expected to get even cheaper and faster. Computation-intensive transactions can be as much as 1000x cheaper on Starknet, and there are plans to improve L1 data costs by integrating support for various Data Availability solutions and support for EIP-4844. With current and upcoming improvements, all Aave operations can get significantly cheaper on Starknet. This means trades, liquidations, and oracles can be cheaper, resulting in more capital efficiency. Cairo 1.0 - New developer experience: Cairo 1.0 is the next step in the evolution of the Cairo language. It is a new compiler being built for Starknet. It will introduce a more friendly language, with many similarities to Rust. Cairo 1.0 smart contracts will be supported in the next Starknet upgrade. Development of phase 2 will be done in Cairo 1.0 from the get-go, thereby making the Aave protocol on Starknet fully compatible with Sierra and future Starknet versions. Cairo 1.0 is the next step in the evolution of smart contract languages. More developer friendly, safer, and faster. Challenges: Unlike many of the chains wher:e the Aave protocol is already live and thriving, Starknet is not EVM compatible and will thus require a rewrite of the Aave V3 protocol to Cairo 1.0. For this rewrite, we intend to ask for a $200,000 grant from the Aave community for development and audit expenses, if this proposal is accepted, and following the network evaluation by BGD, Gauntlet, and Chaos Labs. The total costs of the entire project are significantly higher, and the remaining costs will be covered by Starkware. Road ahead: The proposal for funding phase 1 of the project passed 2 with >340K positive votes.

Under GIP-13 VIBES subDAO was created July 20, 2022 with an initial budget of 50,000 USDC and 10,000,000 GEAR; this budget was allocated for Q3 2022, but has not been fully utilized to this day. You can see all the payments that were made by VIBES subDAO: [Link - VIBES subDAO Payroll]([link]) It is worth noting that with the beginning of 2023 there are more payments and most likely soon the budget will be exhausted (VIBES Q1 2023 payments and a large merchandise order are coming soon) In accordance with the model OBRA adopted DAO, we start the new Q2 2023 and want to get additional budget in advance to implement our marketing plans. This budget will probably also be used in Q3 2023 if not utilized in Q2. So we are not focusing on wasting the budget, but just replenishing our coffers to have the liquidity to accomplish our goals. Key Results and goals. - Higher twitter following. Previous cycle saw following 3x from 17k to 51k. - Higher twitter engagement, previous cycle saw a 72% increment over the May-June period and currently stands close to ATH. - Increasing PR department capabilities. Increase in KOLs, increase in Media outlets, increase in publications. - Higher Discord retention and more active chats. - Increase brand and V3 awareness, current V3 campaign and posts across KOLs and Gearbox have already crossed half a million views. Goal will be to deliver 2.5M views for Redefine. - Increase community base- Adding \u0421assava for specific Africa based expansion. - To increase general awareness and competence regarding use post community expansion. By creating a learning funnel from airdrop hunter  active community member  user  advanced user. Will help Gearbox and DeFi both grow. - Get more feedback about the product and its advantages/disadvantages through regular surveys of active users. If you analyze the past experience, it seems that VIBES coped very well with the tasks that were set for themselves. For this we want to continue to develop the community, as well as to develop the KOLs direction, the referral program and the rest of the marketing and PR activities. Budget for VIBES Q3. The suggested amount is 3,000,000 GEAR which corresponds to $45,000 worth at the GEAR price of 150M FDV [GEAR = $0.015] This amount should be enough for Q2 2023. Additional replenishment of the budget may be required or, conversely, it will be transferred to Q3 2023. For the USDC side, it now has a use as an additional expense item for KOLs has been added. For now, we would like to request $25,000 for those who are strongly opposed to receiving GEAR as compensation. Although we always prefer the latter.

Abstract. This proposal aims to enact a new governance process by which interested parties may apply to the Aave DAO to have addresses be onboarded as GHO Facilitators. The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter. Motivation. The GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement: - a process for facilitator onboarding. - a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit. - a process for facilitator offboarding. This document only intends to address the first of these processes. Implementation. The Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.

Currently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a DEX, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades. Proposal. Velodrome is the leading DEX on Optimism and the top Ethereum Layer 2 DEX with over $300M TVL. It serves as the the primary liquidity hub for the quickly growing Optimism ecosystem, serving 2x - 3x as many protocols of comparable DEXs. Velodrome works by directing VELO emissions to liquidity pools based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs. In the last voting round, bribers received $3.5 in VELO for every $1 in bribes on average. On top of the bribe multiplier, Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargates bribes per the \"Tour de OP\" incentive program, if Stargate moves $1.5M of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to Velodrome and bribes STG-USDC pool. Combined, the bribe multiplier and bribe match can yield a 4X+ impact on liquidity incentives for STG-USDC. The LP will still be used and routed through all aggregators, resulting in the same execution, but an APR higher than what Stargate is getting on the current Uniswap pools will be paid. If this pair performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to Optimism to add to Velodrome and receive additional VELO emissions. The Velodrome team will also work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users. Stargate will also lock farmed $VELO rewards as veVELO to significantly reduce the need for STG emissions in the future while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism. Additionally, locking veVELO will automatically qualify Stargate for a Lock Bonus, typically worth 30%-40% of the VELO locked, paid in OP. Execution. $1.5m of POL will be moved from the Uniswap LP pool to Velodrome on Optimism. Simultaneously, Stargate will begin test run worth $500k in STG to bribe the STG-USDC pool at a rate of $100K per week. Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargates bribes each week. Once a voting epoch is completed on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, VELO emissions will flow to Stargates LP. If successful, this proposal will result in a higher APR to Stargates LP and a significant reduction of STG emissions over time. For the purposes of the pilot, Startgate will focus on locking all VELO farmed as veVELO to build a veVELO voting position and maximize the ROI provided by \"Tour de OP Incentives. This will also earn Stargate additional bribe boosts and lock bonuses which will be compounded into more $veVELO, creating an exponential effect to early $veVELO accumulation. As that position grows, it will direct additional emissions to STG pools, generate fee rewards and bribe revenue that can also be compounded into additional $veVELO. While the focus during the course of this pilot will be to maximally compound rewards, once the veNFT position reaches DAO targets, the DAO can begin to repurpose fees, bribes, and emissions for other purposes. The goal being to reach a state where the DAO can bribe and sustain liquidity without needing additional $STG emissions.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOJtlrjBZmNP5yOfwk7BZpvGOi4U", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954337, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests that Stargate, a protocol, should move some of its owned liquidity to Velodrome, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX), on Optimism.

Designate the \"Cross-chain Native OHM as a pillar project to be included in the bonus program as described in OIP-128. Motivation. OIP-45 (Proteus) demonstrated demand for cross-chain gOHM. Since then, the DAO embarked (and successfully) shipped a major refactoring to the codebase (Olympus V3) In addition, new developments in bridging technology (LayerZero) have opened the opportunity for native OHM on other chains. The DAO is now ready to take advantage of these developments to launch cross-chain native OHM. Cross-chain native OHM benefits Ohmies. Many Ohmies are priced out of participating in the burgeoning Olympus economy on mainnet. By going cross-chain, we give them the ability to participate in the econohmy at the fraction of mainnet costs. Cross-chain native OHM benefits the protocol. It is well-known that liquidity is thinner on L2s. Olympus is in a unique position to expand its liquidity infrastructure services to L2s both by minting OHM and offering incentives to key partners. In addition, the protocol will satisfy demand for OHM liquidity from partners. Project scope. The project makes use of LayerZero technology to mint/burn native OHM. The technology has been audited multiple times and is generally trusted by the broader crypto industry. It is not without risks, however, and we encourage everyone to do their own due diligence before bridging. Our contracts have been reviewed by LayerZero Integration Team and we'll be doing an official audit with OtterSec (a trusted partner of LayerZero) Initial rollout will be on Arbitrum and Optimism L2. The chains were selected based on data from Proteus, community feedback and partnership demand. We intend to expand to other chains in the near future and will be evaluating new chains according to demand from the community, strategic importance, partnership demand and security. Timeline. The timeline for development and go-to market is as follows: - Smart contract development (Arbitrum and Optimism contracts to mint/burn OHM) - completed. - Audit - went into audit last week. - Frontend (updating existing bridge UI) - todo. - Audit Remediation - todo. - QA - todo. - Go-to Market - in progress. - Launch - ETA May 1st Post-launch - ongoing partnerships and GTM campaigns to drive cross-chain engagement. As part of GTM, our partnerships team is reaching out to existing cross-chain partners to discuss gOHM. We will NOT be deprecating gOHM on other chains in the near term; you do not have to do anything at this moment. Any major changes to gOHM liquidity or existing partnerships will be communicated ahead of time and with plenty of time. Our goal is transition all holders to OHM without sacrificing trust of the community. Bonus.

Timeless Finances protocol,[bunni.pro]([link]), is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC gauge in order to receive FXS rewards. Background. Bunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months. Proposal. We propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC 010 [link] Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders. Evaluation of Success. We will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauges by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of the FRAX/USDC liquidity pools along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pools receive. Conclusion. Bunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs. Our liquidity optimization services and incentives will encourage LPs to use our platform and deepen liquidity.

In the specific case of the Euler hack and the potential losses faced by the protocols Core module, deciding on agEUR seniority would mean that once the protocol reopens its peg should be defended using the collateral leftover in the protocol, potentially at the expense of other protocol stakeholders (Standard Liquidity Providers and Hedging Agents notably) Taking this vote will give the DAO the foundation to move forward with next steps following the Euler situation. Context. On March 13th 2023, Euler Protocol suffered a $197m hack, which led Angle Protocol to lose the 17.6m USDC it had lent on Euler at the time. Prior to the Euler hack, the Angle Core module had a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $36.1m and the protocol had holdings of different assets spread across various chains worth ~$1.0m. 17.3m agEUR had been minted through the Core module. In addition, the protocol had: - ~$11.8m in deposits from its [Standard Liquidity Providers]([link]) - ~$71.0k in deposits from [Hedging Agents]([link]) - a surplus of approximately $6.5m. If the funds from the hack (17,614,940.03 USDC) were to be definitely lost, the value of the DAO holdings would be down to approximately $19.5m. In this case, the amount of reserves in the Core module would become inferior to the value of the claims of agEUR holders, of Standard Liquidity Providers, and of the remaining hedging agents in the protocol, as a whole. Should agEUR be considered senior, as the value of the assets of the protocol remains superior to the value of the agEUR issued by the Core module, the protocol could defend its peg using its collateral reserves. [This page]([link]) has more details on the state of the protocol after the hack. As of the 30th of March 2023, a portion of the funds of the hack has been repaid by the hacker. Yet, it is still uncertain how this will route to Angle DAO and with what timeline. Even if a proportional amount of what has been repaid by the hacker was given back to the protocol through Euler, the protocol would still be in a loss situation. Following the hack, the main features of the protocol were paused by its [emergency multisig]([link]) Due to the hack and to the protocol being paused, agEUR has lost its 1 peg. As it stands, if the contracts were unpaused with the pre-Euler hack parameters, it would lead to a bank run situation as agEUR would be redeemable 1-1 against reserve assets, and sanTokens would be redeemable at 1-1 at first, then with a slippage once the collateral ratio is lower. In the end, the last users would be left with nothing as the smart contracts would likely have nothing left to redeem assets against. Some have suggested that instead of running into this bank run scenario, the remaining assets could remain frozen and be redistributed differently according to what is voted. The key question to decide on, regardless of the outcome of the Euler hack, is to determine the order of \"seniority among the different token holders of the protocol. The DAO needs to decide this question not only for the Euler situation, but for all potential such events in the future where a loss accrues in the protocols Core module and is not automatically taken into account by the smart contracts or the voted parameters. Vote. The uncertainty from the Euler situation (about the distribution of the repayment proceeds by the Euler DAO and subsequent repayments by the hacker) may last for quite some time, so the vote here is to clarify the situation for all Angle Protocol stakeholders. This vote is done here in the context of the Euler hack where the DAO may potentially experience a loss, but the intent of this vote is to be a general resolution about the seniority of holdings in the protocols Core module. While, following the Euler situation, a lot of detailed scenarios have been discussed on [Angle Governance forum]([link]) and [on Discord]([link]), the point of this vote is to decide whether agEUR must be considered senior in the Angle Protocols Core module over other protocol stakeholders (Hedging Agents, Standard Liquidity Providers) when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the smart contracts and the voted parameters. In the context of the Euler hack, seniority for agEUR holders would mean that if and when the protocols Core module reopens, agEUR peg should be maintained using the available collateral reserves in the protocol. Implementation and next steps. This vote should not be followed by any immediate action on the protocol. Because this vote is about principles rather than implementation, any plan to solve the current Euler situation if the loss stays as it is would still need to be discussed by the DAO and abide by the foundation this vote provides regarding seniority. For the specific Euler case and the current potential loss faced by the protocol, conditions under which the protocol should be reopened would need to be discussed and addressed in future proposals and votes. Based on the outcome of this vote, and should the protocol loss remain as it is (with nothing from the hacker redistributed to the protocol), there could be a lot of different scenarios to consider to solve the current situation. In the case where agEUR is voted as senior, there could be discussions on the rest of the waterfall, with for instance ideas on whether some Standard Liquidity Providers should have seniority over others, or whether there should be some form of preference for governance token holders in a subsequent breakdown of funds. If agEUR is not voted as senior, the same considerations could arise around the levels of seniority of SLPs or HAs. For this vote, and for future discussions, there are already some places in the docs that refer to this kind of situation: - [Angle Core Module collateral settlement]([link]) with an example implementation [here]([link]) - [Page about SLPs]([link]) - [Angle Core Module risks and emergency solutions]([link]) In all cases, there would also need to be discussions on how to technically implement the next steps that would have been chosen. Voting Options. 1. For agEUR holders seniority over other protocol stakeholders in the Angle Core module. For establishing agEUR seniority over any other assets of Angle Core Module when there is a loss that is not automatically handled by the Core Modules smart contracts and the voted parameters. In particular, this means that the agEUR holders would be senior to other protocol stakeholders (including Hedging Agents and Standard Liquidity Providers) 2. Against agEUR holders seniority over other protocol stakeholders in the Angle Core module. In this case, specific discussions would need to be held to see how to distribute a loss among protocol stakeholders (whether agEUR holders, Hedging Agents or Standard Liquidity Providers) whenever a loss that is not automatically handled by the Core modules smart contracts and the voted parameters accrues.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOK1Df6RNcQoDkESEk1SWQb4WlrB", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954345, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This vote is to decide whether agEUR holders should have seniority over other stakeholders (such as liquidity providers and hedging agents) in the Angle Protocol Core module in the event of a loss that is not automatically handled by the smart contracts or voted parameters.

We chose Balancer to deploy our AMO-styled price defense contract (RAMOS) which paired TEMPLE token to approximately $9mm USD worth of stables initially held in the Balancer USD (bb-a-USD) liquidity pool. The RAMOS contract protected TEMPLE token price from falling below the Treasury stable value backing each token. References/Useful links: Website: templedao.link. Github Page: github.com/TempleDAO/TempleDAO. Communities: discord.gg/templedao / Twitter: @templedao. > MOTIVATION: In February of 2023, Balancer Team uncovered a reentrancy vulnerability for the boosted pools and stopped collecting protocol fees for bb-a-USD. Instead of redeploying a fixed bb-a-USD pool using AAVE v2, Balancer Team chose to push for a new boosted pool (bb-e-USD) that deposited stables into Euler. At the same time, Temple Protocol was asked by the Balancer Team to switch our token pairing to Euler USD. Wanting to be a good ecosystem partner, we switched TEMPLE to pair against the new bb-e-USD which was subsequently affected in the Euler attack. Since trading was paused in the Euler USD pool, we have been unable to resume TEMPLE trading on Balancer nor reactivate RAMOS. This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the new TEMPLE/DAI 50/50 weighted pool which will become TEMPLEs primary LP once Euler restores lost funds to Temple. A new TEMPLE/DAI trading pair would bring significant TEMPLE trading volume to the Balancer platform. In the first two weeks of March before the Euler exploit occurred, the TEMPLE/bb-e-USD LP had generated over $800K in volume. Platform BAL incentives for the new pool would further enhance TEMPLE liquidity to facilitate more transaction volume. TempleDAO plans to be active participants in Balancer governance as not only are we big fans of the technology, but also share a common vision of reducing price volatility, deep liquidity, and customizable asset exposure. > GOVERNANCE: TempleDAO current team has been almost entirely sourced from the community contributors. We started with a top-down nomination system for promotion and are currently in the early stages of implementing a Discord-integrated election system for promoting and demoting team members which will eventually lead to more decentralization. > ORACLES: TempleDAO does not rely on any external oracles. Prior to switching to Balancer, our custom Uni v2 AMM had handled over $300M in transaction volume without any issues. The intrinsic value backing per token against which the token price is indexed is coded into the contract: [hexadecimals] Similarly, after deploying RAMOS to automatically manage the Balancer liquidity, our bot has rebalanced the pool dozens of times to enforce the TEMPLE price floor, which is also coded into the RAMOS contract: [hexadecimals] > AUDITS: TempleDAO contracts have been fully audited by Peckshield. We also have a generous and on-going bug bounty system at hats.finance funded with $400K USD in TEMPLE rewards. > CENTRALIZATION VECTORS: The TEMPLE token is not upgradeable nor pausable. The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract. The community contributors behind the Temple protocol have shown the highest integrity and they have never abused their power, nor committed any actions that would harm the community nor DeFi at large. > MARKET HISTORY: TEMPLE initiated its token presale in October of 2021 and public trading began on its own custom AMM on December 19, 2021. It currently has strategic partnerships with major protocols like Convex, Yearn, Aura, Frax, and Balancer. > VALUE STATEMENT AND CONCLUSION: The TempleDAO Team has been a major adopter of Balancer technology. Our protocol has generated significant volume on the Balancer platform through TEMPLE swaps as well through our previous LBP events. TempleDAO has also been a significant revenue provider for veBAL and vlAURA holders by incentivizing emissions through Redacted Cartels Hidden Hand platform to accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Should the 50/50 TEMPLE/DAI pool become whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would continue to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer, and in particular DAI liquidity paired against TEMPLE. > TEMPLE/DAI 50/50 Weighted Pool Gauge Address: [[hexadecimals]]([link]) > Zapper bundle for TempleDAO Treasury: [link]\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand:"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7WOK1guKavZV2bxaH1wPHh3e6Fypm", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1687954345, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proposal suggests adding a new veBAL gauge for a TEMPLE/DAI 50/50 weighted pool on Ethereum.

The initial liquidity mining program will end on April 5th. The unshETH team plans to conduct the next liquidity mining program on Balancer, and to expand the collaboration between unshETH and Balancer even further in the future. Moreover, unshETH is integrated with an ecosystem partner, Stargate, that will enable scaling of its liquidity. References/Useful links: Website - [[link]]([link]) Documentation - [[link]]([link]) Github Page - [[link]]([link]) Communities - [link] Other useful links? Twitter - [[link]]([link]) Blog - [link] Protocol Description: unshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices. Within Ethereums DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETHs mission is simple  decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network. unshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship. LSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer. Motivation: unshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the first step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains. To achieve this, unshETH intends to begin its second liquidity mining incentives campaign (~1M USH) to veBAL/vlAURA markets. Once this amount has been emitted unshETH will consider future incentives after evaluating the performance of the gauge and depending on future protocol developments. Details: Governance: unshETHs governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023. Oracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time. Omnichain: The USH token is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token. Audits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [[link]]([link]) Centralization vectors: The unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the projects dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance. With the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters. The deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH teams ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023. The launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights. Market History: The USH token was launched on 1/31/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VCs or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog ([link]) to: Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers) Team and early contributors. The airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign. Value: This pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for USH on Ethereum. This gauge is the first step in building a deep collaboration with the Balancer ecosystem and community that will create value for all stakeholders. Balancer and the ecosystem of partners that Balancer has created will be a key part of the growth of unsETH protocol into the market-leader in the nascent LSDfi category. $USH trading metrics as of 04/03/2023 (Sushiswap: [link]): Volume (24h) - $2,529,182 Fees (24h) - $7,588 Utilization (24h) - 106% Specifications: Gauge Weight Cap unshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10% The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes. unshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57. Gauge Type Note that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers. Core Pools Designation: While this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.

The underlying tokens are USDC and DAI. These will each be wrapped through Gearboxs capital provision market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a \"core pool under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens. Gearboxs diverse lending market permits users to borrow for several use cases making the lending market lucrative and beneficial for Balancer LPs to tap into. Gearbox also allows for lending of various other assets and given this initial case this opens the opportunity for more to come in the future.

This is where the boosted source of yield is delivered to the wrapped portion of tokens in this pool. On the opposite side of Gearboxs market, users borrow assets in order to leverage up in various Defi protocols to participate in farms, and function is a \"risk-on\" style of investing. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. Motivation: > Balancers ability to increase capital efficiency using linear and boosted pools is taking shape across the protocol. This Gearbox boosted pool fits Balancers initiative to be a protocol where LPs can safely tap into external yield sources, while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping. This will earn both LPs and the DAO yield and provide Idle with a place for their wrapped tokens to easily be swapped and deposited as the pool increases in TVL. Specifications: 1. Governance: USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. DAI is collateralized by MakerDAO. Gearboxs governance details can be seen [here]([link]) 2. Oracles: This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned. 3. Audits: See Gearboxs [here]([link]) 4. Centralization vectors: USDC is inherently centralized. 5. Market History: See USDC [here]([link])) and Gearbox [here]([link]) 6. Value: LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-g-USD as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

Mark11 (Fraximalist) Summary. This proposal (part of three separate proposals) seeks to approve an AMO for a [2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC)]([link]) on Balancer with AMO injection limits up to 6,000,000 USD value in the first month and up to 12,000,000 USD from the second month. Background & Motivation. Frax has become the master of the Curve wars and Balancer is another frontier. There is a lot of utility and liquidity over at Balancer making use of its unique product offerings. For example things like 20%/80% pools which many protocols prefer for governance token liquidity, and LBP for token launches coordinated through PrimeDAO and Fjord Foundry. Also protocols like Olympus are stationing their main liquidity pools over on Balancer. Balancer also has the ability for protocols to have deployed liquidity in [boosted pools]([link]) such as the pool referred to in this proposal. These pools have the following advantages: High Capital Efficiency Boosted Pools are designed to deliver high capital efficiency by enabling users to provide trade liquidity for common tokens while forwarding idle tokens to external protocols. This gives liquidity providers the benefits of Euler on top of the swap fees they collect from trades. Superfluid, Consolidated Liquidity Nesting pool tokens creates a powerful avenue to make swaps between any stablecoin and underlying borrowing protocol tokens in the Boosted Pool. On top of that, any token in a pool with a Boosted Pool Token can tap directly into the underlying tokens. !([link]]) Example of an already deployed USD pool. We need FRAX to be everywhere and Balancer is likely to be a part of the overall mix when it comes to medium-term liquidity destinations. Relevantly, Aura proposes to be the Convex of the Balancer ecosystem and AURA holders direct the veBAL locked as auraBAL. It can be more economical to bribe AURA holders than veBAL holders directly to direct BAL rewards to a preferred pool. Presently there is a [profitable opportunities]([link]) for bribing veBAL or veAura holders. The 2pool The 2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC) would be initially funded by an AMO deposit of liquidity and allow trades between FRAX and USDC in a capital efficient manner - while earning lending interest from Euler. It would also allow nesting of other tokens with the 2pool for example frxETH-2pool, FXS-2pool, FPI-2pool, etc, and allow direct trading between USDC or FRAX and the nested token (for example ETH->FRAX, ETH->USDC) This can also serve as a rail between Curve liquidity and Balancer liquidity. The 2pool has been deployed by Balancer core team at [Balancer]([link]) A veBAL gauge is being voted on here and is well supported by Balancer governance here [Snapshot]([link]) Security & Risk.
