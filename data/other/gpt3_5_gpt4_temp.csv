"Simple Summary. This proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools]([link]) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Abstract. This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following. 1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. 2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote. 3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs. Motivation. Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum]([link]) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call 02]([link]) Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs. Specification. At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancers BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancers BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancers BatchSwap function. We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1: 1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL. 2. bbfUSD, [expected]([link]) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI. This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO. Upon satisfactory integration <sup>Note1</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: [hexadecimals] Note 1: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user. Rationale. Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancers Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well. Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched. This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration. Considerations. The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net. Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.","The proposal is about integrating Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. This would allow 1inch to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing, and position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools that are launched in the future.",This proposal suggests adjusting the rules for making important decisions about the Aave ecosystem. The current requirements were set a while ago and may be causing unnecessary delays for technical proposals. We need at least 250k votes in support of this proposal before it can move forward. The community will have 7 days to discuss and vote on it.,"The Meta-Governance Working Group wants $632,000 for the last half of 2022, divided into three sections. The biggest chunk, $371,000, goes to two internal groups who've had their budgets approved. $190,000 is for paying the leaders and secretary of our decentralized group.

"Summary. 1inch Network was founded on core values of decentralization and open financial freedom, with a goal of improving the human condition for everyone on the planet. As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need. With that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine. Abstract. Since inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraines conflict zone. Specifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here]([link]) These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items. Motivation. 1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible. Specification. 1. Swap 1,000,500 USDC to USDT within multi-sig on [1inch app]([link]) 2. Transfer 1,000,000 USDT from 1inch DAO Treasury multi-sig wallet to the official humanitarian wallet of Ukraine Due to exchange rates, a slightly higher amount of USDC is required to receive 1,000,000 USDT when swapping 1inch DAO Treasury address: [hexadecimals] Donation address: [hexadecimals] Rationale. This donation address has been [verified]([link]) by the crypto community as legitimate, and has been identified as having a direct impact on the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Ukraine. Considerations. With the 1inch DAO Treasurys historical rate of growth, the donation amount of 1 million USDC will have minimal impact on the DAOs ability to fund future developments of 1inch Network. At the same time, this amount will have a significant impact on the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine and its citizens. For accountability, a screenshot and link to the transaction will be added to this proposal once the transfer of funds is complete.

"Authors: [Trent]([link]) (PG Member), [Tim]([link]) (PG Member) Abstract. This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors. We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [PG twitter account]([link]) Context. 1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - ""Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting]([link]) current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ![0xsplits [image]]([link]) PG Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc) The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO]([link]), and the [vote]([link]) ([forum post]([link])) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. Proposal. We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guilds vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022]([link])), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community: Uniswaps long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients. Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework. Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. Next Steps. If this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.","The Protocol Guild is a council of Ethereum protocol contributors who aim to address the challenges of attracting and retaining talent to work on the protocol.

This means users won't be able to deposit or borrow assets, but they can still repay debt, liquidate assets, withdraw funds, and adjust interest rates. The purpose is to protect users and give the Aave DAO flexibility to take further action. If approved, it will involve changing the Aave Guardian's parameters and updating the IPFS Aave UI to support the freeze.","The proposed security budget for Gelato DAO involves a total cost of 1,298,533.00 GEL, equivalent to approximately 0.62% of the current Gelato DAO treasury. This budget is divided into three categories: refunds at $780,000 (337,662 GEL), rewards or bounties at $210,000 (91,305 GEL), and a future security budget at $2 million (869,566 GEL). The costs are calculated based on the exchange rate of $2.30 per GEL as of January 4, 2022. The question is whether Gelato DAO should proceed with this proposed security budget."
"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves. status: Proposal. author: 3SE Holdings. Simple Summary. This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmonys Horizon Bridge. This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts. Motivation. The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1. This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop. Specification. If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.","The proposal is about freezing all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony.

The current members have become less available, which is why it is necessary to seek replacements. An implementation vote will be conducted later to decide on the new signers and the processes for the Treasury members. The goal of this proposal is to gather a community signal on whether Sushi should initiate the process of replacing the members.","We've been helping people build on Gelato in the Web3 space and recently sponsored a hackathon where 5 projects really stood out. We're awarding them with prizes from our treasury - $4k total in Gelato tokens (GEL). The most creative, CompoundNChill, gets $1k for using our system in an innovative way for token liquidity. Then, four other projects - Backer, Decentralized Roulette, Plottery, and Robusta - each get $750 for their unique uses of Gelato.

"Summary. 1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave. Motivations. Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Networks metrics are below (source 1): Total trading volume: $160B. Total swaps: 5.91M. Total users: 1.25M. 1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange. The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4. In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors. Benefits to Aave Community. 1INCH is highly liquid. 1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage. 1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Resources. Website: 1inch.io. Token: [hexadecimals] 4. Governance Forum. Discord Chat. Github. Documentation. Blog. Twitter. Coingecko. Dune analytics. Specification. 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token. 1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols' revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3. 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? 1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space. 1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX. 1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling. On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?) How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced? The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. 1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time. 1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running. 1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency. P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token. 1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions. Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. How is the asset currently used? 1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO. Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3. Emission schedule. The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4. Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached) Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply) Token & protocol permissions and upgradability. The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded  new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance. The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The tokens mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4  there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately. 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig. Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs. 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing. 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals. st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocols governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100% There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively. v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH. The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAOs treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M. The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing. The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value. On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH. There is an extensive list of audits available on Github.

If they agree, there will be a secondary detailed vote on who will join the group and their future processes. In short, this proposal is to check if the Sushi community wants to start the process of changing the Treasury group members."
"Enable agEUR as a collateral in isolation mode on AAVE V3 on Polygon. Summary. Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there. At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero. There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap]([link]) and on [Curve]([link]) Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite. Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism. The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave) The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

Audits. We have had four different audits which can be found [here]([link]) Benefits for Aave V3. agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg. One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the  and short the $ through agEUR. Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the . This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future. Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, theres also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment. Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole. Risk Parameters. With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters. V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token See agEUR summary section 3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset? See Benefits for Aave section. 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?) Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics.

How is the asset currently used? The asset is a  stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere. It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi 6. Emission schedule Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. Theres no emission schedule for the token. 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do?

"[ARC] - UI/UX upgrade governance framework. The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features. That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge. To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting, also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users. As recently, we have witnessed multiple demands from third-parties to be integrated in the aave App (wallets, on-ramps etc.) The presented framework intends to provide governance guidelines to standardize the process of integration into the Aave App. Title [ARC] - integrate [Entity] into the aave app. [Proposal] Brief presentation of the entity and ecosystem 250 words max. [Proposed integration] Brief presentation of the requested integration. examples: a wallet requesting a direct support on user onboarding. an onramp requesting the integration of an onramp widget. a notification system requesting to be integrated into users dashboard. a portfolio tracker requesting link in users dashboard.

How does the integration benefit the Entity Aaves current and potential future users? [Technical integration] Link to Aave interface PR requesting the integration. This framework is intended to provide standardization of UI/UX integration of the Aave App. The proposed governance process for a UI integration is to have each entity do a governance thread open for at least 5 days. Then open a snapshot vote with a starting voting period of 24h in the future with at least 3 days open vote period considered valid with a 100k AAVE YAE vote quorum. the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAE/NAY/ABSTAIN. The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they don't detect security issues, will merge the PR. In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote, the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security.","The proposal is about creating a governance framework for integrating third-party entities into the Aave app. This process will involve a thread being opened for discussion for at least 5 days, followed by a snapshot vote with a 24-hour starting voting period and at least 3 days open for voting.","This proposal suggests donating 1 million USDC from the 1inch Network's treasury funds to provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine.

"Add borrowing support for RSR (Reserve Rights Token) on Aave. References. Project description: [About the Project - Reserve]([link]) Project description: [link] Protocol description: [Introduction - Reserve]([link]) Protocol documentation: [Protocol description - Reserve]([link]) Source code: [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol]([link]) Ethereum contract address: [hexadecimals] Chainlink Oracle: [RSR / USD | Chainlink]([link]) Audits: [link] Paragraph summary. We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol. Motivation. The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens) The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol]([link]) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset) We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocols design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave. When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RTokens full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now. Specifications. Link between the author & the project: The Reserve team. High level overview of the project: The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+ cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them. ![image]([link]) The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily ([link]) The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc) A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RTokens collateral. We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s) Why would RSR be a good borrow asset? We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield. These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don't expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform. Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand. By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties. Brief history of the projects components. The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol. The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later. An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve]([link]) How is the asset currently used? At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes: 1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens. 2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc) Emission schedule. The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors. The [Slow Wallet]([link]) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. Its under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks. More details here: [Release schedule]([link]) Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers? The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply) The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig]([link]), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.,"The proposed governance aims to protect contributors of the AAVE community from hacking incidents. If AAVE community members are hacked, it is important to safeguard innocent users who can provide evidence, rather than protect the hackers in the name of decentralization. The suggestion is to have the AAVE.com administrator prohibit access to suspicious funds and provide evidence of their origin. Additionally, their transfers can be banned or permanently frozen within the pool.","The proposal suggests that we use 6,310,350.00 GEL (3%) from Gelato DAO's fund to carry out strategies that improve how much money is available in our system. The first step involves creating a ""Protocol Owned Liquidity"" managed by Gelato DAO with the help of Olympus Pro, using G-UNI as our money tokens. This idea aims to allow easier trading of GEL with Ethereum in Uniswap v3 by having more money available for transactions. Further plans to boost available cash in the system will be provided and voted upon separately. The key question now is whether we should go ahead with these money-boosting strategies."
"Link to proposal summary: [link] --- Requested Budget: Allocate a Marketing & BD Budget of 5,250,000.00 GEL which is roughly 2.5% of the initial DAO treasury. This should enable Gelato to kickstart a more aggressive marketing and BD campaign starting in May for the foreseeable future, probably lasting for at least one year. Estimating an exact time frame for how long the budget would last is always difficult because the $GEL price is quite volatile, but this should definitely work for the next 12 months. Important to note: The GEL Budget will of course not come into circulation all at once, but slowly and steadily via smaller payments to hackathon winners, influencers that spread the word about Gelato and Business Developers like Dave who bring traction to the project. The higher the $GEL price will be over the next months, the longer this budget will last! Should Gelato DAO execute the outlined security budget proposal?","The proposal is about allocating a marketing and business development budget for Gelato, which is a project aimed at making it easier for people to use decentralized applications (dapps) The budget would be used to pay for things like hackathon prizes, influencer marketing, and business development efforts.","This proposal suggests using the funds from Sushis Treasury to stake the cryptocurrency TOKE, which could generate a return of 16% to 31%. The goal is to make the treasury more productive and sustain the protocol in the long term by earning yield.
