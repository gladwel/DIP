As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need. With that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine. Abstract. Since inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraines conflict zone. Specifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here]([link]) These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items. Motivation. 1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible. Specification. 1. Swap 1,000,500 USDC to USDT within multi-sig on [1inch app]([link]) 2. Transfer 1,000,000 USDT from 1inch DAO Treasury multi-sig wallet to the official humanitarian wallet of Ukraine Due to exchange rates, a slightly higher amount of USDC is required to receive 1,000,000 USDT when swapping 1inch DAO Treasury address: [hexadecimals] Donation address: [hexadecimals] Rationale. This donation address has been [verified]([link]) by the crypto community as legitimate, and has been identified as having a direct impact on the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Ukraine. Considerations. With the 1inch DAO Treasurys historical rate of growth, the donation amount of 1 million USDC will have minimal impact on the DAOs ability to fund future developments of 1inch Network. At the same time, this amount will have a significant impact on the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine and its citizens. For accountability, a screenshot and link to the transaction will be added to this proposal once the transfer of funds is complete.

The 1inch Network aims to improve the human condition worldwide, and as a leading DeFi platform, they want to provide assistance to those in need. They have accumulated a significant amount of USDC in their treasury over the past three months. The funds will be converted into USDT (another type of cryptocurrency) using the 1inch v4 protocol and then transferred to Ukraine's official wallet. The funds will be used to repair infrastructure, support health facilities, and provide food and hygiene items to the affected citizens. The 1inch Network believes it is their duty to support civilians within conflict zones.

This proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools]([link]) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Abstract. This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following. 1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. 2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote. 3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs. Motivation. Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum]([link]) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call 02]([link]) Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs. Specification. At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancers BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancers BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancers BatchSwap function. We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1: 1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL. 2. bbfUSD, [expected]([link]) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI. This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO. Upon satisfactory integration <sup>Note1</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: [hexadecimals] Note 1: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user. Rationale. Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancers Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well. Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched. This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration. Considerations. The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net. Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.\nI understood the text and explained what the proposal is about:"

        "content": "You have following proposal:\nSimple Summary. This proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools]([link]) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Abstract. This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following. 1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. 2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote. 3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs. Motivation. Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum]([link]) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call 02]([link]) Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs. Specification. At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancers BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancers BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancers BatchSwap function. We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1: 1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL. 2. bbfUSD, [expected]([link]) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI. This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO. Upon satisfactory integration <sup>Note1</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: [hexadecimals] Note 1: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user. Rationale. Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancers Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well. Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched. This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration. Considerations. The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net. Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand"

As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need. With that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine. Abstract. Since inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraines conflict zone. Specifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here]([link]) These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items.

Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched. This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration. Considerations. The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net. Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.\nSummarize it into one paragraph with simple language to make it easier to understand"

Balancer Boosted Pools are gaining popularity in the DeFi space, and integrating them would allow the 1inch Aggregation Protocol to access more liquidity sources. Balancer DAO would provide a grant of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs upon successful completion of the integration. The integration would enable trades to be routed through the Balancer Boosted Pools, offering optimal pricing for users. This would unlock $350 million worth of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, as well as provide a potential source of volume on other networks like Fantom. The grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration, and other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made concurrently."
