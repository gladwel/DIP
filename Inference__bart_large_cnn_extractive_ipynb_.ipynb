      "Authors: [Trent]([link]) (PG Member), [Tim]([link]) (PG Member) Abstract. This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors. We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it. Useful links [Protocol Guild Docs]([link]) [1 Year Vesting Contract]([link]) [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021]([link]) [List of Members]([link]) [PG twitter account]([link]) Context. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, its just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is. Heres a longer exploration of the [project rationale]([link]) If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - \"Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019]([link])) What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer: current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting]([link]) current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust. To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here]([link])) This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs]([link]) have more information. ! [0xsplits [image]]([link]) PG Pilot. Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we're ready to test the mechanisms efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc) The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO]([link]), and the [vote]([link]) ([forum post]([link])) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here]([link]) Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested. Proposal. We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guilds vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022]([link])), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community: Uniswaps long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including: [The Merge]([link]): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability. EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF]([link]) [Statelessness]([link]): sustainable management for state growth. Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844]([link]), [EIP-4488]([link]) [Proposer Builder Separation]([link]): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants. Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework. Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap communitys existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity. Next Steps. If this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.\n",

      "title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves. status: Proposal. author: 3SE Holdings. Simple Summary. This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmonys Horizon Bridge. This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts. Motivation. The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1.\n",

      "This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop. Specification. If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.\n",

      "Summary. 1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet. This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave. Motivations. Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Networks metrics are below (source 1): Total trading volume: $160B. Total swaps: 5.91M. Total users: 1.25M. 1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network.\n",
      "\n",
      "1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange. The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4. In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors. Benefits to Aave Community. 1INCH is highly liquid. 1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage. 1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n",

We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.

However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, it's just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. 2.

The options are: 1) keep the pricing of WBTC based on the underlying BTC, same as currently on Aave v2 Ethereum and other pools OR 2) change the pricing model to use WBTC-based feeds. Context There has been extensive discussion on [[link]]([link]) about the topic, and with Aave v3 Ethereum upcoming, it is fundamental for the community to take a decision. Generally, the risk entities currently engaged with the Aave community agree that using a WBTC/USD (or ETH) feed with option 2 can bring some benefits to the pool. From the technical side, at BGD we think both options are perfectly legitimate, but when having enough liquidity (and WBTC seems to have it), usually it is better to price directly based on the asset itself. What the approval of this proposal implies? Whatever option the community adopts will be applied on Aave v3 Ethereum. \n",

      " Title: bDIP-02 : Coordinated Timing Across BanklessDAO Scope: Minor Change Draft Author: Rowan (chunz) Working Group: Operations Department [Link to Working GDoc]([link]) BDIP SUMMARY The [BanklessDAO Constitution]([link]) doesn't specify a single timezone around which we can all effectively coordinate. This may seem inconsequential most of the time, but twice each year confusion manifests as some regions observe \"Daylight Savings, while others do not. This bDIP will establish Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) as the single reference timezone for meetings and events across BanklessDAO. BDIP BACKGROUND BanklessDAO is a global community, collaborating across countries and timezones. So far, we haven't identified a single reference timezone for scheduling calls and events, and most of the time it's not an issue. Twice each year, however, some regions shift their clocks by an hour, while others do not. Further, this shift isn't coordinated across regions and occurs on a different date depending on where you live. \n",

Background Alchemix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset protocol that gives users advances on various yield strategies via a synthetic token. The Alchemix loans are self-repaying, interest-free and non-liquidating. Today, Alchemix offers various strategies to borrow against select USD-pegged stablecoins (alUSD) and ETH (alETH). Alchemix's focus over the last months has been to expand cross-chain and to deploy new yield strategies for the existing alAssets. In parallel, the Alchemix and Olympus teams have also been exploring the creation of a new alAsset and to launch alOHM as the next product. \n",

For Olympus, alOHM represents a novel use case that adds further utility to the token. Ohmies will be able to take out liquidation and interest free loans, enjoy similar Alchemix strategies for alOHM as for alUSD and alETH, as well as LP the alOHM/OHM pool. From the protocol's perspective, it is invaluable for other protocols to build on top of the OHM monetary layer and so we want to support the (first) teams doing so. As a piece of background information, the feasibility of creating new alAssets for Alchemix depends on various factors, such as demand, a sustainable yield source, and a clear path towards profitability. The major expense for Alchemix to launch a new product is the creation and incentivization of a new liquidity pool for the synthetic asset. \n",

First, Olympus would help co-incentivize the liquidity pool during the initial bootstrapping period. More specifically, this would be support in the form of $50k per quarter for a total of two (2) quarters. Alchemix will combine these funds with up to 500 ALCX/week to incentivize/bribe the pool in order to attract liquidity. Second, Olympus would deploy 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity at the start. These funds would be sourced from previously inverse-bonded OHM.

When a poll is open during two different reporting periods, it leads to confusion on whether that poll should be first counted for delegate compensation purposes. There has also been interest from delegates in a linear penalty vs a cliff for compensation. Summary of Amendments 1. Clarification that a poll is only counted for participation once that poll has closed (in the \"Reporting & Administration section). 2. Removal of the preamble that is no longer relevant (prior the \"Motivation section). 3. Inserted a link to a Dune query to help delegates calculate their HOP for a period; removed language stating that a query would be made after HIP 4 was approved (in the \"Reporting & Administration section). 4. \n",

For reference, a few benchmarks: a delegate holding all 1 billion HOP would receive 12,075 HOP per month. 10 million HOP, a delegate would receive 8,575 HOP per month. 1 million HOP, a delegate would receive 5,075 HOP per month. 100,000 HOP, a delegate would receive 1,575 HOP per month.

First, a group decision was made to add Tritium as the seventh Maxi. We have interfaced with him over the last few weeks and believe his skill set to be complementary to the responsibilities carried out by Maxis. One near term initiative for Tritium will be decentralizing Balancer's snapshot operations and dissolving the Governance Council. A proposal will soon be presented for community feedback on this topic. Prior to joining the Maxis Tritium contributed at Badger and Aura. The second major change compared to Q4 is that Maxis took over the lead on Partnerships for the ecosystem so we've added a relevant section outlining our key objectives in this area. The north star success metric is increasing protocol revenue, with secondary goals being growing TVL dominance on L2's and increasing market share of DEX volume. \n",

      " Introduction One of the biggest changes Balancer made to veCRV when we released veBAL was the use of BAL/WETH 80/20 BPT as the locking token instead of BAL. This has allowed BAL to have extremely deep on-chain liquidity relative to our circulating market cap, all without having to spend costly emissions on BAL liquidity incentives. Encouraging the adoption of similar ve8020 systems across DeFi is a key strategic objective for the ecosystem. This kind of locked liquidity is far more sticky than usual TVL earned from liquidity mining, plus Balancer's emissions will not be the primary driving force behind users choosing to participate as the project itself will contribute their own emissions, revenue sharing, gauge voting, or similar mechanisms. While the benefits of adopting ve8020 are numerous it remains a relatively novel concept that most users are not familiar with. It will require additional dev work from projects looking to adopt this compared to single token locking. \n",

Program Outline This program is intended to support all systems which involve the staking/locking of 8020 BPT. ve8020 is one such system and it's a convenient shorthand to use, but this program is not limited to \"ve systems only. I suggest leaving the qualifications for participating as soft requirements since it's difficult to account for every possible future situation. We must carefully balance spending BAL to drive ve8020 adoption in a bear market with vaporware projects adopting it just to get paid. Some factors Balancer governance should assess for projects adopting ve8020: Project track record - has it been around awhile, is it likely to exist going forward, does it have an active community/user base, etc. \n",

Balancer is looking for ve8020's that not only drive high TVL but also drive protocol revenue. All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL and ideally the project will provide the necessary 20% of ETH so that no BAL is sold. Proposed Milestones Upon a successful Balancer governance vote for a project to join this program they would immediately be eligible for a grant of 25k BAL.

However, there is a need to update and clarify this process to better reflect the needs of the community and ensure that all decisions are made in a transparent and fair manner, while balancing efficiency and responsiveness in decision-making. To that end, we propose the creation of a modified voting framework that will allow for more flexibility and responsiveness in decision-making. 1) No vote nor HIP needed. The Community Multisig can execute autonomously if small values are involved/transferred (less than $5,000) and does not directly benefit any person/entity outside of the Hop DAO itself.

Background A few months ago, Olympus community had identified & whitelisted AURA & veBAL tokens as strategic assets for multiple reasons outlined in the referenced proposal (OIP-110). As some yet-to-be unveiled projects undertaken by the DAO are coming to fruition, gaining governance power over the Balancer ecosystem becomes one of the strategic priorities for the Olympus Treasury. Motivation As mentioned in the whitelist proposal, acquiring AURA tokens offers Olympus Treasury the flexibility to accomplish multiple different goals such as: Drive third party liquidity to Olympus pools Incentivize new Olympus liquidity products and partnerships Voting for protocol-owned pools and farm rewards Gain governance influence over the Balancer ecosystem Execution Olympus DAO is committing to buy the equivalent of $1M worth of AURA over the next 6 months. \n",

      " Summary The proposed pilot programme is the first foray of Olympus in DeFi lending markets and aims to introduce and promote OHM as a borrowable asset. More specifically, through this programme the protocol would mint up to 200k OHM and lend it out (in tranches) on Silo and Euler to test demand and interest rate models. Motivation Up to this point most integrations of OHM/gOHM in lending markets have focused on the collateral-side. With the recent changes through RBS and the resulting price stability and low volatility, OHM/gOHM are becoming preferred collateral assets to use - as the recent listings on Silo Finance and Fraxlend have shown. At the same time, it is important for the protocol to also start focusing on the lending-side of the market and to promote OHM as a good borrowable asset as well. There are a few different reasons why. For borrowers it diversifies options to borrow \"stable-ish assets beyond just USD stablecoins. \n",

      " For traders and speculators it provides the option to hedge or short OHM, both of which are not easily doable today. While this may seem like a downside, shorting or hedging allows for more natural market dynamics and price discovery, and helps to prevent unsustainable premiums. For Ohmies lending markets also adds additional utility in that they can lend out OHM to interested parties on various lending platforms. More importantly though - from the protocol's perspective - is that lending markets allow for more efficient scaling of OHM as well as diversifying the assets that back circulating OHM. Rather than being exclusively backed by treasury assets, OHM minted into credit markets would be backed by a basket of collateral assets (or rather, a claim on those assets). As a result, the OHM supply could theoretically grow without increasing the treasury assets and/or diluting liquid backing of the floating supply. \n",

In addition to this if Real USD ever falls beneath 100% collateralization ratio, 50% of the daily rebase is instead added to the treasury to re-collateralize USDR. 2) Real Estate price appreciation - When priced in FIAT Real Estate has a long predictable history of appreciation. \n",

The goal of these vaults is to allow ETH exposure to increase decentralization but reduce the overall volatility of ETH. Upon approval we will deposit 150E (~$225k) each into the two available Opyn strategies (Crab USDC and Zen Bull). Following six months of deposit period, we will share the performance of these two deposits - the vaults automatically rebalance MWF. Background: OIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. This proposal seeks to add Opyn's Crab V2 Strategy to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap. As this is a whitelist proposal, a risk analysis was performed and can be found below.

Abstract Many interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol.

Abstract The CRV Supply Cap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 7.18% with a Utilization of 44.48% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1]. This proposal intends to increase the CRV Supply Cap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves. Capital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, doubling the interest rate at the Uoptimal point, and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. \n",

The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand. Llama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield.

How Does the DSR work? - Dai holders can lock their Dai into the DSR smart contract at any time. Once locked, Dai continuously accrues to the users balance, based on the current DSR. - Dai holders can earn savings automatically and natively while retaining control of their Dai.

      " Since FIP - 137 authorized the Fraxlend AMO to issue a new FPI pair (FPI/FRAX - Variable Rate V2), the pool has generated significant protocol revenues, as well as heavy lending and borrowing activity. Current pool utilization stands at 91% with total FPI collateral value at $17.8m. At time of writing, the lender APY is at 5.7% and borrower APY is at 6.2%. Both rates are rising quickly. Building on the success of the FPI pool, additional AMO injected liquidity would help bring the target pool utilization back down to the nominal range of 75% to 85%. More importantly, raising the liquidity cap would expand and diversify the borrower base to increase financial access for all users. We note that authorizing the new higher limit does not require the AMO to provide the specified liquidity. The liquidity will be authorized and available to be injected, consistent with the AMO operations framework and protocol risk parameters, to meet user demand as deemed appropriate by the Frax Team. \n",

Stargate currently uses the newest ULNv2 validation library ([link]) that launched on September 5, 2022. This has been in production for over 4 months and has seen $2,203,933,589.46 volume pass through Stargate along with 1,501,174 messages over LayerZero. During the time Stargate has been using this LayerZero released a new validation library called Featherproof ([link]) which is actively used when interacting with Aptos. Featherpoof has been used in production for 4 months, has seen 185,448 messages go across it. Featherproof secures large applications like CAKE, BTC.b, and TheAptosBridge and offers a drastic reduction in gas  reducing gas costs by over 20%. \n",

      " Gas costs have commonly and repeatedly been brought up as one of the largest limiting factors of the current Stargate implementation, this would be a massive improvement in that. Proposal Stargate should adopt Featherproof. This would result in a bare minimum cost of 20% less gas in all transactions and in certain edge cases (such as aggregators) can result in more than 90% less gas cost. A more consistent and significantly cheaper gas cost will make Stargate more usable, more frequently utilized within all third party routing, and offer a significantly better user experience to all. Execution A configuration change to the relayer Stargate uses would need to happen for this to be enabled. Stargate will need to select Featherproof as it's validation library rather than ULNv2. This can be done near immediately after this proposal passes. Success If successful, Stargate's gas usage will decrease by at least 20%. This will give Stargate an edge in an a bridge landscape that is growing more competitive over time. \n",

Abstract If passed, this proposal will change the way that 1inch Fusion orders are filled by allowing all five resolvers to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction. This change will increase competition amongst resolvers and ensure that users are getting the best rates. Motivation Currently, the top five resolvers are given fill priority according to their Unicorn Power. For the first minute of the Dutch auction, only the resolver with the highest Unicorn Power can fill the order. Then, the resolver with the second most Unicorn Power joins them for the second minute, and so forth... This proposal will foster a more competitive auction by giving all resolvers equal priority. This proposal aims to increase competition amongst resolvers and thus provide better rates for users when they make swaps via the 1inch Network. \n",

([link]) Above is the existing Fusion auction order structure. Below is the modified Fusion auction order structure that this proposal calls for. ! ([link]) Rationale Allowing for pure competition amongst the five resolvers, rather than giving preferential access based on staking power, will facilitate better swap rates and faster execution times. This change will also make it more attractive for professional market makers to become resolvers, which may lead to a greater demand for 1INCH token as they accumulate the necessary Unicorn Power.

Abstract There is currently [$32.9m of BAL]([link]) idle in the Balancer Treasury. [BIP-52]([link]) was the first proposal to suggest depositing BAL into Aave deployments to earn yield. This proposal builds on BIP-52 and presents an opportunity to the community to deposit an additional 44.5k BAL into the Polygon v3 deployment. When BAL is listed on Aave v3, this proposal recommends migrating BAL deposits from the Aave v2 deployment to the v3 deployment on Ethereum.

This favours moving sooner before the upgrade to increase borrowing rates goes live. Balancer is currently supplying 41.65% of the liquidity into the Reserve and given Balancer has a long term view, evident by the duration of the current deposits, there are no perceived issues with being able to withdraw a portion of these funds at any time. The difference between the SupplyCap and BorrowCap on the Reserve acts to make liquidity available to users who wish to withdraw funds when the Reserve is at max deposits and max borrowings, 28.5k BAL when proposal linked above is implemented. This exit liquidity is something Balancer needs to consider, it could lead to needing to withdraw funds gradually over time.

Most people know ConsenSys for Metamask, Infura, and Truffle, but we're here to talk about something else: a zkEVM Rollup. We recently launched the [Testnet]([link]) (open only for allowlist users) and are reaching out to propose deploying Hop for the ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet and subsequent Mainnet. ConsenSys follows the progression of the Hop ecosystem closely and even recently integrated Hop into our [bridging aggregator]([link]). Hop is a unique and critical piece of infrastructure that seamlessly bridges assets between chains. Proposal Details Proposal This proposal asks the Hop community to support bridging using the protocol between the ConsenSys zkEVM and other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Motivation What is particularly exciting about the ConsenSys zkEVM is that it is a type 2 zkEVM. As a result, it is EVM equivalent, meaning existing smart contracts, toolsets, and release processes can be easily deployed without substantial modifications. This means de minimis switching costs for dApp developers. During the Testnet phases and Mainnet, we expect a robust user base that will drive activity to the Hop protocol (and community) as demand for bridging increases. Also, the protocol will be the first to integrate with the native zkEVM bridge, which is a significant opportunity for the Hop ecosystem.

This ragequit function would provide community members with more flexibility and freedom in managing their capital, while also ensuring that the underlying protocol is not effected with significant risk and also makes a profit if this proposal passes. As pointed out by the community members, the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since existence, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards. The proposed solution is a ragequit function that would allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a 10% slash. \n",

Yield from these yield strategies is then distributed to SLPs, to veANGLE holders and a portion goes into the protocol reserves. So far, as described in [the docs]([link]), Angle yield strategies consist in lending to Aave, Compound (and Euler for DAI) and the funds go to the lending venue that that has the highest APR. This strategy however is inefficient, and better can be done. Imagine having to allocate funds to a basket of 3 strategies yielding an APR. In DeFi usually, the more you lend to a place the lower your APR. And so instead of lending [0,0,100] to 3 protocols, you may very often be better off lending like [0,30,70] or like [10,30,60] to optimize the global APR you're getting. \n",

Sufficient liquidity in these pools facilitates swapping with reasonable slippage, and incentives create a yield farming opportunity for LPs of liquid FRAX with a unique risk profile. Since clevTokens represent future yield rather than a pegged asset (see next section) LP pairs are correlated, limiting the scope of impermanent loss to LPs and making these farms unique in the market. clevTokens are not wrappers of their underlying collateral tokens.

These limits will be raised as liquidity grows. clevTokens can eventually all be exchanged for corresponding real collateral tokens at 1:1 via the Furnace, so they can be considered a zero coupon bond with indefinite maturity. If the furnace currently holds collateral tokens the swap is immediate, but users can deposit clevTokens to the Furnace even if there are no collateral tokens currently available. In this case, users share the upcoming harvests proportionally with any other Furnace depositors.

Borrowers swap when the discount is sufficiently small and, on the other side of the equation, users can buy clevTokens from the Curve pool to arbitrage the discount.

Abstract Following on from the forum discussion relating to wETH and wstETH interest rates across Ethereum v2 and v3, this Snapshot will focus on implementing the wETH interest rate parameter changes on Aave v2. Since the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. This proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend. \n",

      " Motivation Since AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave's wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below. ! ([link]) The market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below: Structured products charge a fee Additional smart contract risk Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity Our analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed. \n",

Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.

Motivation The compensation framework outlined in [OIP-102]([link]) has served the DAO well over the past 6 months. However, we believe there is room for improvement. Due to the overall market sentiment and events that transpired in this year, the OKRs, most of which were market-driven, have not been met. These OKRs were meant to be difficult, but the main issue we found was that the contributors couldn't directly affect them and thus felt unmotivated when it was clear the market wouldn't allow us to reach them. The proposal below outlines how we plan to tackle that problem, as well as ensure timely completion of projects that are in the best interest of Olympus and its community. Proposal Bonus Instead of the current OKR-based bonuses system outlined in OIP-102, allow for a total bonus budget of $1,000,000, to be paid in (g)OHM. \n",

Background and Motivation Frax Ether is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smooth the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH. In just 85 days, frxETH has gone from 0 to 50k in supply, which was an essential milestone for Frax and highlighted the success of its design. But it also shows that Frax Finance has a great product that can be quickly adopted by the mass market. However, as we look to the future, it's essential to focus on creating deep liquidity for frxETH. This will improve the trading experience for current holders, make it more attractive for new users to enter the market, and drive further adoption. \n",

This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges. The optionality of a 1bp fee tier is useful for stable-to-stable swapping and can often be found among the top ten liquidity pools on each of Uniswap's respective deployments. Since the launch of the 1bp fee tier on mainnet, [Polygon]([link]), and [Optimism]([link]), the 1bp fee tier has directly led to growth in Uniswap's DEX market share and directly competes with stablecoin DEX protocols. !

To ensure the safekeeping of Launch Auction Stargate tokens, the StargateDAO proposes to re-issue all Stargate tokens (STG). By re-issuing STG, StargateDAO would eliminate the risk of illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alamada wallets and would protect the interest of all token holders. As background, on March 17, 2022 Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from the Stargate Community sale. Alameda subsequently publicly committed to lockup all these tokens until March 2025 ([link]).

If such an actor were to claim and dump STG on the market, in violation of the three year lockup agreement, the following could occur. The actor would hypothetically claim the tokens as they vest to the wallets over a 6 month period for example. This would introduce 100,000,000 STG (10% of total supply) into the circulating supply over the next 6 months.

Abstract Across the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled. The stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave's revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave. \n",

      " The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers. Motivation The stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. Demand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave's revenue. The charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. \n",

Proposal To support Aave's multichain expansion, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to Neon EVM on behalf of the community. Neon EVM is a first-of-kind EVM-compatibility solution for the Solana blockchain. The tool allows Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on Solana, allowing Ethereum dApp developers to leverage their knowledge of Solidity, developer tooling, and existing codebases to scale with Solana, which lets dApps take advantage of the best features from both blockchains. Neon EVM offers Ethereum ecosystem dApp developers increased throughput and swift block time on Solana, with low gas prices and no need for changing code  anyone can run Ethereum contracts on Solana with Neon EVM. It also introduces incentivised transactions-facilitating Neon EVM operators to the Solana blockchain.

We feel it is appropriate for the council to be smaller as well. - The reduction would increase the efficiency of the council.

Synapse enables the transfer of reserve assets (stablecoins, ether, etc.) and partner assets (e.g. gOHM, VSTA, GMX, etc.) across a number of EVM and non-EVM compatible chains. Since launch, Synapse has processed $12.5b worth of cross-chain bridge transactions, across hundreds of thousands of transactions. Synapse has a native governance token SYN, which is distributed to liquidity providers. SYN is currently tradable on both decentralized and centralized exchanges, with robust liquidity currently on SushiSwap. Motivation SYN currently has a large 50/50 pool of liquidity on Sushi.

      " [PR with multisig payload]([link]) Authors Pendle Finance, with support from Aura contributors Summary Pendle is proposing to enable a Balancer gauge for a PENDLE-ETH pool on mainnet with a 2% emissions cap. Protocol Description The Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via the custom V2 AMM. This brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. PT is the equivalent of [zero-coupon bonds]([link]) while YT is the equivalent of [coupon payments]([link]). By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. \n",

It also functions as the governance token, by staking and locking into vePENDLE. With vePENDLE, an array of new features are unlocked for PENDLE holders, increasing the token's utility. The Pendle protocol collects a 3% fee from all yield accrued by yield tokens (YT) and 80% of the swap fees(0.1% of the trade at a 1 year maturity) in the V2 AMM. Currently, 100% of this fee is distributed to vePENDLE holders, while the contributors collect no revenue. This is subject to change in the future.

Abstract If passed, this proposal will allow st1INCH(v2) holders to participate in 1inch DAO Snapshot votes. Legacy st1INCH and v1INCH will have unchanged voting weights. Motivation With the passing of [[1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods]([link]), and the subsequent launch of 1inch Fusion mode, st1INCH(v2) has become the primary utility token of 1inch Network. In recent weeks, st1INCH(v2) has overtaken legacy st1INCH in terms of supply. This proposal will enfranchise st1INCH(v2) holders and should increase the number of active participants in the 1inch DAO. Specification The [1inch Network Snapshot space]([link]) will be updated to account for st1INCH(v2) voting power. Meaning, st1INCH (v2) will be added as a new \"strategy with equal voting weight to legacy st1INCH. \n",

By introducing this class of voters, we can better reflect community sentiment while ensuring that those with vested interests remain incentivized towards long-term success of the network. Legacy st1INCH will retain its voting power for the time being. It is expected that the DAO will vote to deprecate legacy st1INCH voting rights in the coming months as more of the stake migrates to the new contracts.

This governance committee will be in charge of ensuring that the PSP rewards distribution is working as intended, and will meet regularly to monitor this. Context First [introduced in the PSP 2.0 proposal]([link]), the role of the Governance Committee (or GovCo) is to ensure that the systems being introduced remain fair and unbiased, as well as execute Emergency Measures in case a key vulnerability is found (which are exemplified later in the proposal). This proposal seeks to expand this into a more detailed framework, exploring the structure of GovCo, the responsibilities of members, as well as a list of potential members to be nominated for the first iteration of the committee. \n",

This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAO's DAI stable coin. Closing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions. \n",

While MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the \"Endgame plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool.

The Curve closes and all DAI are distributed according to the terms decided by AavegotchiDAO in a subsequent AGIP. Risks The risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature.

As such, we're pursuing a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending market (LFRAX) in order to bolster more liquidity (already have an OTC bribe set up).

We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO. The split would be as follows: Liquidity: 25% The DAO: 25% Pixelcraft: 25% Protocol rewards: 25% By protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. \n",

It comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for agEUR for several months now). AIP - 50 A Curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of agGOLD. Yet to further connect agGOLD with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it. agEUR is already a connector token for routes involving Euro stablecoin trades. It should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains. Proposal is to mint 50k agEUR, the corresponding value of agGOLD, and add full range liquidity to a UniV3 pool agEUR-agGOLD with 0.3% fees. \n",

If the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted agEUR and agGOLD with providing liquidity with them. The amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. The bigger the volume the smaller the loss. We have built[an impermanent loss simulator]([link])to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation.

If impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then agEUR and/or agGOLD might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins.

Due to budgeting and planning constraints, it will likely consist of a single member to start. I, Jared Hedglin, working through Hedglin Consulting, would like to propose myself for the role spanning an initial three month engagement. Motivation Gearbox has the potential to become a leading DeFi protocol financially empowering an entire new class of investors who may not have access to similar financial services due to geography or economic status. However, to establish the project as the dominant composable leverage protocol - a potentially enormous category - deeper liquidity on the protocol's supply-side is necessary.

Compensation Benchmarking According to data from Pave 1, the median salary for a VP of Business Development is around $185k and a total annual cash compensation of $200k. I will be taking on more responsibilities than just a VP of BD, but added this comparison for context. It's worth noting that these numbers do not include benefits such as health insurance, which I will have to pay for out of pocket. Additionally, there is no bonus associated with this position, so the total cash compensation is equal to the base salary. In comparison to the market, this proposed salary is competitive but slightly below average for the DAO. These numbers also do not consider any additional liability or risks.

Abstract The utilisation of the MaticX reserve has been trending higher over time and with the introduction of deposit rewards, there is an expectation the SupplyCap will be reached prohibiting additional MaticX from being deposited. Increasing the SupplyCap enables the recursive MaticX/wMATIC strategy to grow beyond the current constraints.

The circulating supply of BUSD will thus trend toward zero over time. This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to freeze BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Abstract This ARFC proposes to freeze the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. Motivation While BUSD is not an asset with borrowing power, and recent development does not present risks of excess debt, From the 21st of February 2023, the circulating supply of this asset will eventually go toward zero. As there's no real prospect of growth and the inability to mint new BUSD might hurt peg arbitrage opportunity and asset peg. \n",

Currently, the winner of the solver competition is rewarded an amount of COW token based on the orders that are included in their solution. This per-order rewards model does not take into account general market conditions or how difficult it was to find a solution. It therefore requires constant readjustment and it does not incentivize research into tackling challenging batches, e.g., utilizing the value of CoWs. The proposed auction mechanism allows for dynamically finding a reward based on how much value a solver provides to users by settling a batch. This results in a distribution of rewards better aligned with goals of the protocol, solvers, and users. \n",

There are several issues with the current model: It is parameterized by an ad-hoc minimum reward of 37 COW per order. It is oblivious to how easy it is to detect the best execution (thin vs thick competition). Auctions with multiple identical submitted solutions are rewarded the same as auctions with only one valid solution. It does not (as much as it should) reward innovation and taking advantage of CoWs and structurally better solutions (e.g., detecting CoWs vs execution with touching the same pool multiple times). It is oblivious to the volume of an order and the particular pairs traded. Ultimately, the current model is quite static, does not directly take protocol viability into consideration, and is not adaptive enough to the ever-changing competition landscape. The proposed reward mechanism results in an improvement of all those issues. \n",

Specification Per-auction rewards are computed using a second-price auction mechanism for the quality of solutions: 1. Each solver commits to a score and a solution. 2. The winner is the solver with the highest score. 3. The winner gets to settle the auction on chain, and is payed 'payment = cap(observedQuality - referenceScore)'. Here, the observed quality is 'observedQuality = observedSurplus + observedFee', as executed on chain. The reference score is the second highest submitted score. The uncapped payment of 'observedQuality - referenceScore' is capped from above and below using the function 'cap(x) = max(-c, min(c + observedCost, x))' with a cap 'c' of '0.01 ETH'. Submitted scores have to be positive. We note that the (protocol-submitted) empty solution, having a zero score, will always be considered in the ranking. \n",

The payment described above can be decomposed into a reward and a gas reimbursement. In the case of a successful settlement, the gas reimbursement is equal to 'observedCost' of the settlement, while the reward is 'payment - observedCost' which is equal to 'min(observedQuality - observedCost - referenceScore, c)'. For a failed transaction, the gas reimbursement is zero and the reward is negative and equal to 'max(-c, -referenceScore)', in which case the winning solver would have to pay the reward to the protocol.

If at the end of an accounting period (currently: a week) the total amount of performance based rewards to be paid to solvers is smaller than the amount committed to by the protocol, the remaining sum is distributed to solver teams which consistently provide solutions. Those rewards will be distributed pro-rate to solvers based on the number of auctions they submitted a valid solution for over the accounting period. The capping of performance based rewards is chosen such that the total rewards for all solvers amount to around 15_000_000 COW tokens per year (see section on experiments). This is comparable to the rewards payed to solvers in Nov-Jan. The remaining COW tokens of the total allocation of 20_000_000 COW are rewarded based on consistency. The cap of 0.01ETH will be adjusted one time after 4 weeks of using the new reward scheme. \n",

If the amount of rewards payed in that period extrapolates to significantly less than 15_000_000 COW per year, the cap will be increased. We will monitor the additional constraint 'score < observedQuality' for submitted scores and add this rule to the social consensus rules. Implications for solvers With the new reward mechanism solver teams would have to submit not only their solution but also a score. The score can be interpreted as expected quality - expected costs. A profit maximizing solver would maximize their score, which in turn would mean that they maximize expected quality - expected costs. The second-price mechanism means that solvers would truthfully report this expectation. \n",

      " The change of the reward mechanism will thus require solvers to adapt their strategy a bit: Instead of just maximizing quality - costs they now explicitly have to take into account revert risks. This moves complexity to solvers, as proper risk management is going to be required to be profitable. The new reward scheme does not by itself enforce maximizing surplus of users. This is because in the score computation a smaller surplus of a solution can be compensated by a smaller cost e.g. due to positive slippage. We want to avoid the situation of solvers decreasing surplus and will therefore monitor and enforce EBBO (Ethereum's Best Bid and Offer) rules more strictly, see the social consensus rules in [CIP-11]([link]). Transitioning period Solvers have to learn to submit scores, e.g., by having a model for revert risk and costs. Therefore we propose a transitioning period for the new reward mechanism along the following lines: 1. \n",
