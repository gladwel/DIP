      "The proposed security budget for Gelato DAO involves a total cost of 1,298,533.00 GEL, equivalent to approximately 0.62% of the current Gelato DAO treasury. This budget is divided into three categories: refunds at $780,000 (337,662 GEL), rewards or bounties at $210,000 (91,305 GEL), and a future security budget at $2 million (869,566 GEL). The costs are calculated based on the exchange rate of $2.30 per GEL as of January 4, 2022. The question is whether Gelato DAO should proceed with this proposed security budget. \n",

      "We've been helping people build on Gelato in the Web3 space and recently sponsored a hackathon where 5 projects really stood out. We're awarding them with prizes from our treasury - $4k total in Gelato tokens (GEL). The most creative, CompoundNChill, gets $1k for using our system in an innovative way for token liquidity. Then, four other projects - Backer, Decentralized Roulette, Plottery, and Robusta - each get $750 for their unique uses of Gelato. These spanned from a decentralized version of Patreon, an automated roulette game, a fundraising lottery system for DAOs, to an option trading protocol on Uniswap v3. \n",

      "The proposal suggests that we use 6,310,350.00 GEL (3%) from Gelato DAO's fund to carry out strategies that improve how much money is available in our system. The first step involves creating a \"Protocol Owned Liquidity\" managed by Gelato DAO with the help of Olympus Pro, using G-UNI as our money tokens. This idea aims to allow easier trading of GEL with Ethereum in Uniswap v3 by having more money available for transactions. Further plans to boost available cash in the system will be provided and voted upon separately. The key question now is whether we should go ahead with these money-boosting strategies. \n",

      "This proposal is for an implementation of SushiGuardRouterV01 that aims to provide MEV protection for Sushi users while also collecting profits from arbitrage. This action will mean more revenue generation by capturing profits usually made by bots. Manifold Finance will take a share of these profits for handling the necessary infrastructure and its management. The proposed upgrades will reduce gas costs, allow for back running swaps with Kashi/Bento and AAVE, and facilitate easy tracking of profits from back running swaps. The potential monthly profits could reach between $420k and $1.84m, spread across all operating chains. The plan calls for Sushi to cover some costs initially, with Manifold offering to help finance the routing contract. The total estimated costs are around $80k USDC and $250k split equally between sushi and usdc. The key point of this plan is to bring SushiGuardRouterV01 into play and seize profits from back run arbitrages. \n",

      "The proposal suggests a two-part plan regarding SushiHouse, a Set Token previously managed by Yam's team for bear market safety. As the management is not available anymore, the proposal recommends that Sushi's Treasury should reclaim the funds currently in SushiHouse tokens. In the first part of the plan, a decision will be made about redeeming these funds. Once that is resolved, the second part will discuss if the reclaimed funds should be sold for stable cryptocurrencies. This could involve either Over-the-counter (OTC) trading or on-chain transactions - the one causing the least price disturbance will be chosen. The breakdown of tokens and their allocations are provided in the forum proposal. In short, part two debates whether to sell the redeemed SushiHouse funds for stable cryptocurrencies in the Treasury. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main aim of this proposal is to decide whether the assets from SushiHouse, a cryptocurrency token set up by Yam's treasury team, should be returned to the Sushi Treasury now that the management team isn't around anymore. This involves two stages; first is deciding if the assets should be reclaimed, and then deciding whether these assets should be sold for stablecoins. The reclaiming is simple; it just involves breaking down the SushiHouse tokens and restoring the funds back to the Treasury. The selling stage will require some research to find out whether over-the-counter or on-chain settlements will be best for preventing losses during the exchange, likely with over-the-counter being the best choice. So, the nutshell is, we aim to first reclaim SushiHouse assets to the treasury and then figure out the best way to sell them. \n",

      "The Sushi Treasury, controlled by an 8-member group, is considering replacing 3-4 of its members due to their availability issues. These members were initially picked almost two years ago through a public election. The aim is to bring in new members who can approve transactions more promptly. However, before this change can happen, the Sushi community needs to signal their agreement to start this process. If they agree, there will be a secondary detailed vote on who will join the group and their future processes. In short, this proposal is to check if the Sushi community wants to start the process of changing the Treasury group members. \n",

      "KlimaDAO aims to include the cost of carbon emissions in our economy by creating a carbon-based currency. This organization has chosen Sushi as the primary platform for trading these credits, turning Sushi into a key player in the on-chain carbon market. Now, KlimaDAO wants to create an option for Sushi users where they can choose to offset the carbon emissions produced by their trades. The idea is to have a simple switch that users can turn on or off as they wish. KlimaDAO is willing to do the necessary research and development work to add this feature and will collaborate with Sushi's development team to ensure it functions correctly. In simple terms, KlimaDAO wants to build a feature on Sushi that allows users to reduce their carbon footprint. \n",

      "This proposal suggests changing how the 1inch Network DAO collects its revenue. Instead of swapping it into USDC, the idea is to buy the DAO's own token, 1INCH, when its price is less than $1.30 and switch to buying USDC when 1INCH's price is more than $1.70. This could help the 1inch Network DAO invest in its token when it's cheap and put potential growth pressure on the 1INCH token. The plan also automatically reduces risk by collecting stable coins when the token is expensive. It's a cautious move that might reel in profit, but it would also add more complexity to how DAO's revenue is collected. And since the token value could be volatile, the DAO's treasury might stand at risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal is about diversifying the 1inch network's funds. Right now, all the token revenue is converted to a type of token called USDC, which is tied to the US dollar. However, with the US dollar inflating, these funds lose their value over time. The proposal suggests keeping some types of tokens as is instead of converting them to USDC. These include ETH, WETH (both different versions of Ethereum), WBTC (a version of Bitcoin), DAI, and USDT (both alternatives to USDC). The idea is that these tokens might increase in value over time, counteracting the inflation of the US dollar. All other types of tokens will still be converted to USDC. \n",

      "This proposal suggests adding a feature to the 1inch Protocol that will gather and organize various derivative products, with the first product being the Opium’s TURBO options. If implemented, 1inch, a leading decentralized exchange aggregator, would expand its services to include these derivative products. This addition will need technical support from the 1inch Labs and sponsorship from the 1inch Foundation. The actual details of the operation will only be decided once the 1inch Foundation approves the proposal. For safety, a deep security check will be conducted before launching this on the mainnet. The Opium community will help with this integration process, and the good thing is, this will not require treasury funds from 1inch. \n",

      "The authors have developed a new trading protocol called Rage Trade, built on top of Uniswap v3, which is designed to be more efficient for traders and liquidity providers. Rather than creating a fully independent system, they've added new features to the existing Uniswap framework, like leverage trading and real-time funding rates. This requires an additional use grant, similar to a previous proposal by Voltz Protocol. They believe their changes will bring new liquidity to Uniswap v3 and allow for new trading strategies. They are seeking approval and feedback from the Uniswap community. \n",

      "This proposal aims to implement a one basis point, one tick fee tier on the Optimism Layer 2 network through a process involving proposal, voting, queuing, and execution via a contract architecture called Timelock. In brief, once the Timelock contract is given its command, it will transfer the action to Optimism's CrossDomainMessenger. This messenger then transfers the action over to Uniswap's CrossChainAccount on Optimism, which can execute tasks on protective contracts. Once verified, this CrossChainAccount forwards the action to the UniswapV3Factory contract. The final effect is the enabling of a 1 basis point fee tier. This process will be tested and executed on both the Kovan test network and mainnet. \n",

      "The Gnosis Chain team has proposed to deploy Uniswap v3, a prominent decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, on the Gnosis Chain. They believe the deployment would nurture expansion within the DeFi ecosystem and offer increased opportunities for experimentation and testing. They also emphasize the chain's compatibility with Ethereum and its unique features including stable, low-cost transactions. As part of the deal, Gnosis Chain is offering up to $10M in incentives to support the adoption of Uniswap v3 over a two-year period. The proposal also includes a plan for cross-chain governance in collaboration with the Nomad team. They are now waiting for approval from both UNI and GNO token holders to proceed. \n",

This step aims to expand the reach of Uniswap, a decentralized exchange platform, into the growing Polkadot market while also providing a way of safely testing decentralized governance. Using Moonbeam, there's potential for Uniswap to become a leading liquidity platform in the entire Polkadot ecosystem. The proposal also includes a commitment of $2.5 million from Nomad to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund further development and expansion of Uniswap in a multi-chain environment. \n",

This move will be good for the Aave community and will also be controlled by them via votes.

Currently, the Safety Module only covers the Ethereum market, leaving other markets with less risk protection. The Safety Module was designed to safeguard users from potential deficits and has become one of the most significant risk mitigation pools in the DeFi world. With the V2 markets thoroughly tested and demonstrated as secure, it seems appropriate to extend the Safety Module's protection to them, diversifying risks and promoting market growth by reducing risk for liquidity providers. The proposal makes the point though, if the protocol fails due to the factors beyond Aave's control (like failures in other chains such as Polygon/Avax), the Safety Module won't cover these situations. If users agree with extending the protection, they can vote FOR in the upcoming vote. \n",

The Safety Module, which has $700m in holdings, offers substantial protection for Aave users. However, the protection is currently only available for the Ethereum V2 market. The idea is to include previously high-risk, but now heavily tested, markets as well. By providing equivalent protections across markets, it can help enhance market growth, ensure fairness for liquidity providers, and diversify risks. Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that the Safety Module wouldn't stand for failures caused by other chains like Polygon/Avalanche themselves. Finally, community members can vote 'for' extending coverage to Polygon, 'against' changing existing arrangements, or 'abstain' from voting. \n",

The reasons supporting this increase include steady liquidity of about $40m, a healthy loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and a tightly maintained conversion rate with AVAX. Furthermore, sAVAX is a fairly mature asset that has weathered large price fluctuations since its February 2022 launch. A vote will decide whether to increase the sAVAX limit or not. \n",

This will provide more uniform risk protection to all users across these markets, which have become significant parts of Aave's ecosystem. The Polygon and Avalanche markets, in particular, have attracted many new users and generated substantial revenue. However, the SM will only cover any failures of the Aave smart contracts, not those caused by the chains themselves. If accepted, this extension could lead to further market growth by lowering risk for liquidity providers. The final decision will be made through a vote.\n",

This means if the market is bad, Aave can decide to reduce how much you can borrow against your collateral. This could cause users, who borrowed close to the limit, to face liquidation. But, before any reduction, there will be announcements so users can adjust their positions to avoid this. The community is voting on how much the liquidation threshold should be reduced - the options are 0% (no change), 1% (less risk but less profit), 2%, or 3% (more risk but more profit). These changes won't be made during serious issues like software bugs and will apply to all assets supported by Gauntlet including WETH, WBTC, DAI, etc. \n",

This means that Bitcoin users could join the DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, world via the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge. This bridge was created with safety, cost-effectiveness, speed, transparency, and ease-of-use in mind. BTC.b is already accepted by multiple DeFi platforms and is a secure method to get Bitcoin on-chain. The plan is to offer a max Loan to Value (LTV) of 70%, a liquidation threshold at 75% and a 6.5% penalty for liquidation.

      "This proposal is about making changes to seven areas of risk, particularly the Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four Aave V2 assets to keep in line with the moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. We recommend updating these parameters to control insolvency, the amount of loans borrowed, and the risk of asset liquidation. We are decreasing the liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ in particular. Using data gathered from various factors, like trading volume and market impact of trades, we've managed to get a more nuanced understanding of risk that isn't limited to simple rules. Additionally, we offer key statistics and results from our simulations on our risk dashboard. Please note that no accounts would be liquidated due to these updates at the moment. However, this could change depending on price fluctuations. Lastly, we regularly update our risk parameters to keep the protocol's market risk at safe levels while also making sure operation is cost-effective. \n",

      "The proposal suggests adding LUSD, a stablecoin produced by the Liquity protocol, as a borrowable asset on Aave. The Liquity protocol lets users create LUSD by holding Ethereum (ETH) as collateral. The key attribute of this stablecoin is that it's trustless, meaning it doesn't rely on any authorities or intermediaries making it decentralized. LUSD also has mechanisms for price stability and is overcollateralized by ETH. The proposal suggests that adding LUSD on Aave can offer a unique borrowing option, and that the stablecoin has already proved durable under market stress. The Liquity protocol, and by extension LUSD, is fully permissionless with no governance, which could be an attractive attribute for decentralization purists. Overall, this proposal aims to expand the use of a decentralized, trustless stablecoin in the DeFi ecosystem. \n",

If this proposal goes ahead, 1INCH token owners could use their tokens as collateral within Aave's loan system. This could provide Aave with a boost as 1INCH is not yet listed on any other decentralized lending platforms, and it could benefit 1INCH token holders by giving them a new way to use their assets. \n",

These solutions have contributed to Gnosis Chain's impressive stats - the chain has a total value locked (TVL) of $290M and handles over 130k transactions per day. The proposal points out that there's been growing community interest in using GNO to earn extra yield, indicating that it's a liquid asset. In fact, GNO pools on several different protocols currently hold over $108M. The proposal also includes a thorough risk assessment of GNO based on Aave's Asset Risk Framework.

By integrating with Aave's Portals, it can quickly borrow and repay assets across various chains. This helps improve efficiency and can also enable larger cross-chain transactions. The deBridge project itself has been thoroughly vetted for security and has processed over $45M in volume since its launch in February.

Rocket Pool allows anyone, regardless of how much Ethereum they own, to participate in validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and earn rewards. It transforms the staked Ethereum into rETH tokens, which can be freely traded and gradually gain value. Given Aave's position as a significant player in the cryptocurrency space, the addition of rETH could benefit both Aave and rETH holders. This proposal also lays out potential risks and proposed risk parameters, including limits on Loan-to-Value and liquidation thresholds, which would be more conservative than those for Ethereum due to the added risk associated with rETH. \n",

ENS's success is closely linked with the development and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol, and by supporting the Protocol Guild, the ENS community would be investing in the long-term health and evolution of this crucial infrastructure.
